       "'Came here for the witches, stayed for the Gwent.\\nGreat horror game, can get a little repetitive so a new fresh set of maps is ideal.The level up system is trash, i\\'ve never been so confused between 2 addons, offerings, and perk system.Major downfall is the match-making system, you can be thrown against a level 39 killer with 3 of the 4 survivors a level 1.\\nits very good\\nAmazing!!!!!!!!!!!!\\nIf you are looking for a fun game to play this game is the game for you. Constant laughs and funny references combined with action packed game play and a open world full of nooks and crannies for you to explore. All this and more makes this game one of my favourites.This game has created many memorable moments and is worth more then it\\'s extremely low price.The verdict - 9/10\\nbest 3rd person survival game in my opinion especially with the dlcs.\\nGOOD HUNGRY JACK GAME\\nthis is a amazing game\\ngreat game play it like everyday i recomend this for everyone\\njust full of action packed fun\\nSticks very true to the original while using the HD textures, one thing I would actually like to see if the rewing ability that is only found on the XBLA version\\nA nice racing game.Sadly MP is somewhat dead. I recomend to play it with friends.\\nFreakin Crazy epic awesome adventurePerfect puzzle game you can keep coming back to!\\nIve only played this DLC for a good 2 hours and I\\'ve made a memory I\\'ll be fond of for a good time. Having everything i chopped down taken by monkeys and manure thrown at me by another monkey. Being the level headed person i am, I then proceeded to burn down the forest they inhabited including their house. Karma came full swing then when i realised i burned everything on the small island, which left me stranded until i starved.10/10 will burn again\\nBest gamer ever Must have\\ngreat game although i\\'m never been play metalgear before so i dont know older version is good or notrecomment for 18+ becauce its have violence scene\\nFirst of all its got quite good graphics but not the best. It is better than the previous borderlands but not by much. its a good game:-)\\nRogue Legacy is a good game for the price of purchase. It features randomised dungeons every time, though you can unlock a feature to lock the previous anscestors castle if you so choose so you can play through it again for anything you may have missed or failed the first time through at the cost of earning only 60% gold on the playthrough.Classes are all unique in their own ways with their own pros and cons (I personally preferred the Ninja/Hokage) and traits can provide some useful and not so useful mechanics to help or hinder you. Its a long grindfest at first since you are pretty weak at the start, but as you level up and upgrade your stats and equipment it does get somewhat easier though it still provides a challenge regardless.The story is kind of there but not all that interesting though there is a interesting plot twist at the very end, though story can be found as well through diary entries you will discover through your numerous playthroughs. It can be a long grind to the top but I find its worth it in the end.\\nFun cheap OLD SKOOL strategy RPG. Turn based good graphics. Actually fun and has multy player.\\nAMazing gameplay and very fun to play. It feels like you are in the origional movies!\\nAn amazing game. Using the physics of the real world. You can do anything you want really. And now with a multiplayer mod you can have space wars.\\nBoderlands 2 is a great game to have a fun and high octane shooter with your friends or even man it yourself. THe game has a great sense of progress as you continue on your journey to stop Handsome Jack you cmoe across a wide range of enemies. Every gamer who plys this game will have that sense of power as they come from klling weak enemies to taking on bosses and badasses. THis a great gme for anybody who wants a shooter with tons of loot and a seemingly endless amount of content. This game is a must have.\\nGreat Game so enjoyable to play and so chill\\nGreat game good for people who love fps games. Great weapon handling and accuracy\\nif u want to rekt some n3rds this is ur game!\\nLOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!! AMAZING GAMEPLAY LONGTIME PLAYERbut I hate the installing process, super annoying!\\nThis is a very unique FPS game with 9 classes with their own perks and roles, ranging from the genius Engineer to the mysterious Pyro, and special events such as Halloween with limited cosmetics. There are millions of possiblities with this game (Thanks to the many unique hats and weapons) and there is a constant stream of free updates and patches. TF2 (Team Fortress 2) rarely has hackers (If any) on servers due to a very reliable and effective anti-cheat system (VAC). TF2 also has a kind and welcoming community so, new players can get familiar with the game with ease. TF2 is also very balanced  so you don\\'t have to spend a fortune on the game just to get the hang of it. As I mentioned before, there is a diverse range of well-made cosmetics and weapons to personalise your characters just the way you want them to be. There is also a constant stream of weapons/weapon reskins and cosmetics that are made by the glorious steam community with their amazing item-making skills. Oh, did I forget to mention that there are many taunts to annoy the hell out of your enemies? So what are you waiting for? Try this game out NOW!\\nDungeon Keeper 2 was and is still one of my favourite games, I\\'ve reinstalled that game mulitple times to replay it but its always unstable and now as a Mac gamer I also have to run it through Crossover/Bootcamp, its a hassle. I\\'ve hoped for a new Dungeon Keeper for years so when I saw the kickstarter for WFTO I jumped straight onboard. I didn\\'t play it while it was in beta, I wasn\\'t interested in guiding the game through its development, I just wanted it made, I didn\\'t play it when it first went Gold, I heard it was buggy, and read the message from Subterranean Games, so I waited a bit longer, until today...This has been sooo worth the wait, I\\'m only a few levels in but absolutely loving it, it looks fantastic and plays brilliantly and hearing Richard Riding\\'s voice brings me straight back, thank you Subterranean Games for bringing this classic gameplay back to life with such love, I can finally throw away my DK 2 install disk!\\n7/10 no australian servers for good ping but awesome game\\nThis is a really good game. With a low price tag and good replay ability with its randomly generated worlds and tons of content makes it worthwhile. With the fact that it is also multiplayer just seals the deal. Its mod ability may be low compared to a power house like “Minecraft”, but it has enough content to compensate, great bosses and events to give a fun challenge, and a large variety of blocks which can lead to many beautiful structures. Also with a large amount of items your gameplay can be changed, between but not limited to: A Melee Tank, A Mage, or a long ranged gun user/bowman, all of which can be mixed up with different items and accessories.\\nSame thing as the first, but better.\\nJust like home, only in 3D\\nI really like this game but to much people try scam you for stuff and troll you to get you banned but I still do recommend it because its very fun to play\\nThis is so addicting and i feel like im A LEMON STAND ADDICT\\nBest R.T.S in the world and I know that because when the first AoE came out i started to play all of games since the first one EVER!!!ADD ME AS A FIREND\\nPlay the game,and enjoy the happiness\\nTeam Fortress 2 (aka TF2) is one of my all time favourites and was the game that brought me into the steam comunity over 5 years ago now. bought it before it was free and was definately worth it <3 fantastic game no matter what class or what map your on. with all the mods and varrying game modes, its never a dull game for me\\nBalls-to-the-wall insanity. Gameplay is fun, heaps of replayability. Good story, interesting characters. Well worth it.\\nIt\\'s good game\\nBEST .  GAME . EVER .\\nthis is the type of action game that you can play as dinosaurs in a war i recomend it cause i love playing this game\\nOne of the best modern combat games i have ever played. 9/10\\nAfter playing this game for the first time (so my review is going of my first impression of playing the game) it was a nice little fun game to play where your main objective is to destroy your competition. The art style suits the game very well and looks awesome! If you wish to look at my first play of the game link is below\\nAmazing\\nI killed a dragon with my fists..\\nI love this game it makes me happy inside just trying to level up and get more upgrades all they need to do is add talking to the other person.\\nMaximum.Lolidrive wasn\\'t taken, 10/10\\nAlthough some users are experiencing difficulties from crashes and glitches in the game, there is no denying that this still is the best PC game out in the market right now. Single player - 10/10Epic action packed story, never a dull repetitive moment. Multiplayer - 7/10 Little to no lag, heist is great. But has a tiresome lobby system with crazy amount of loading time that kills the gameplay experience even when installed on SSD.Gameplay - 9.5/10 Everything you love about GTA franchies but more and better.\\n< 3\\nReally good. when i was much newer i had a really hard time getting into the game but once you get the hang of a class it beomes really fun\\nI spent 5 minutes playing this then i realised that fish are eating each other! We need to fix this problem in the game it\\'s a massive bug the FISH EAT EACH OTHER!?\\nits awesomeno rly\\nThe greatest game ive ever played\\nThis first person zombie killing/ RPG is a must have, All classes and weapons are well balanced across the maps. The different scary, sounding monsters require are entertaining to destroy and each monster requires a different stratergy to kill. Enemies are tough when you play solo, that\\'s why I recomend playing this game co-op with your friends for a much more rewarding and enjoyable experiance.This is why this game is a must have!ZIKOZ90\\nawesome game but needs 2 things 1 able to aim downsight 2, add more monsters chupacobras big foot lochness that kinda stuff\\nthis game is very fun and gets better everyday\\nReally miss virtual sailer, which wasn\\'t VR but was the best sailing game out there.I jumped in to have a look at VR Regatta and like the other reviews,  I know it has great potential.If this game goes MP, I\\'m in. Everything worked nice. A bit tiring on the steering as for a tight turn, you had to move the stick a metre but I\\'m sure that will all change.I got a little sea sick, but nothing I couldn\\'t handle. Funny thing is, I stay on my boat 3 days a fortnight and never get sea sick but some VR games just get to me.Comfort rating would be a 6 out of 10. Great work. Stick with it.\\nGet 2 shadow cases from drops opens one gets SSG Big Iron opens the other one gets M4A1-S Golden Coil.Opens 100$ worth of cases gets Negev Man-O-War;-;Gaben is loveGaben is life\\nMy fave game\\nThis is a amazing game and given the fact the it is still early acess is amazing. the graphics and gameplay are amazing, the crafting system is diffrent in a good way and i look forwed to further updates for this game.\\nThis is a quick intro for those who want to get into the franchise but actually haven\\'t played a souls game. I know I needed this when I started.The good:-You can build a character around a variety of archetypes, want to be a reaper complete with scythe and dark magic? What about a shield and spear hoplite? Maybe you feel like beating people to death with an anvil-on-a-stick while wearing stone armour. You can. -Fighting isn\\'t just swapping out weapons with different numbers, you get invested in your gear. You\\'ve chosen to be a reaper? Well you\\'d better learn how to reap with that build. No matter your setup you will learn to use it and you will have to behave differently for each. -When you\\'re on fire it feels like being Neo dodging bullets without the slow mo. It could all come crashing down in an instant but for a while you\\'re untouchable.The bad:-Not holding your hand is a selling point but when you don\\'t have a clue about certain game mechanics you\\'re pretty much boned unless you find a guide. Read up on effigies, game progress routes and the Emerald Herald.-\"It\\'s a game that too often sacrifices fun, replaces it with tedium, and tries to defend that choice by calling it a challenge\" I\\'m not proud of quoting gamespot but this was always stuck in my mind. As newcomer, aggroing one enemy at a time, cheeseballing, and even waiting for hp to regen before moving on (I know, I know, but gotta hoard effigies) seemed to be the only way to play. All to avoid having to repeat a section, lose my souls and lose precious max hp.The ugly:-Tongue but holeSumming up, you will have to be persistant. If you can accept that it might take a few dozen deaths to clear an area and let your rage go then it\\'s a rewarding game.\\nGreat game, well worth the grind for good weapons/characters.\\nThe game i always wanted! Good!!!\\nGood free game\\nGET IT!\\nDecided to write this one a quick review because at the time of writing it\\'s on sale. I bought this game a few months back when it was $20 and it was worth it. It\\'s a fairly challenging coop shooter with Zombies and it\\'s a lot of fun. Plus it\\'s 3 games in one, so for $8.99 it\\'s a steal. This game features the stories from NZA 1 and 2 with updated textures, an exclusive third story continuing on from the other two that you can only buy in this collection, and a decent survival mode which is also exclusive to the trillogy. All are available in 4 player coop.It has a fairly healthy online community, but it\\'s certainly best with friends, which is why I don\\'t have much time on it. That said, it has a certain dark humour to its story which makes it both endearing, but also a bit terrifying at times. If you\\'re a fan of Call of Duty Zombies, particularly World at War, you\\'ll probably love this. I have a fairly mid range PC (AMD FX-6300, R9 270x) and I run this at 80 fps 1080p on high with supersampling off and it runs beautifully. The graphics are pretty decent too.If using an Xbox controller is your thing, the controller support is fantastic. Simply turn it on at any point and it\\'ll work just fine. I use a 360 controller, but the game most certainly supports an Xbone controller too (it\\'s image is used in the controls section of the options).Basically, buy it now while it\\'s on sale because it\\'s great. If you happen to read this after a sale, it is still worth getting it over the other two if you want both.\\nThe best game in survive game the BEST11111\\nOk. Let me get this straight. This game is incredible from it\\'s trading economy to competitive highlanders and even a game mode where you and your team verse a big strong man who goes by the name Saxton Hale. This game has absolutely everything. But don\\'t forget it\\'s amazing community with it\\'s SFM animations and it\\'s wacky Garry\\'s Mod animations and thousands of pages of Fan Artwork. But did I mention the Hats? Yes, this name could infact go by the name Hat Simulator 2007. People go CRAZY for this special type of quality hat called an \"Unusual\". I unboxed my first yesterday and from a $2.49 Key, you get a $40 Hat. That is what strived me to write this rather long review for this Amazing Game. So, in the end, do I recommend it? HELL YES!\\nSuper quirky cult classic game, chock full of morbid humour and occasionally disturbing situations. 100% recommend!\\nCommander Keen. Many of us have played this game in our youth. The plot was just wacky enough, the gameplay just great enough, to make this many people\\'s favorite platformer.With a great level set-up, and secret passages, this game is a must-try. If you like old platformers, you will love this one. If you like any platformer at all, you will like Commander Keen 4.\\nresource intensive.\\nI\\'ve been waiting for this game to come out on PC, and this is purely the reason I got a steam account. This is a wonderful puzzle, point and click game, with an excellent soundtrack and storyline. Beautiful art style. Absolutely loved it :D\\nPuts mario kart shame because it has better visuals characters and more fast paced game play.\\nPLEASE GIVE US AN AUSTRALIAN SERVER!\\nbest JOB euw\\nPretty much anything you can imagine, so long as it is within the boundries of Source 1, you can make.Disclaimer: \"Pretty much anything\" is subject to the amount of knowledge and experience you have with 3D modeling tools, porting models and their rigs and knowledge in film creation both real and digital. If user is not pertained to these traits, they can make anything beyond their imagination...NOW GO MAKE SOME FILMS AND REVOLUTIONIZE THESE TRAITS OF KNOWLEDGE!Right after you figure out the UI and how to use Google.\\nThis is a highly polished and fantastic game for all zombies fans! I loved this game when it came out and I love it now!This is the best coop game I have played!\\nAmazin!\\nI Love Episode 2 But I NEED HL3 TO LIVE!!!!!!!!\\ncrash blow stuff up really fun\\nok so when you purchase this game the first thing you have to do is go to the nvidia website and download the legacy driver otherwise this game wil come up with a stupid agia physics missing error and WILL NOT LAUNCH and it will drive you mental.I started the game and had a sound hardware error which was stupid. no sound but to be honest the game mechanics allow you to easily play without sound. graphics completely maxed out still seem outdated for a 2009 release. however I have to say that graphics don\\'t make or break a good game. frontlines offers a multiple path choice play style which I am rather a fan of in an fps. its great to be able to choose how you want to get to a target. i thought the health system could do with some improvement. I semed to get hit a hell of a lot yet didnt seem to lose much in the way of health, and I found the constant birage of new spawning enemies somewhat unrealistic. however if you like a tactical run and gun style gameplay with constant enemy attacks to overcome then this is a good game choice.I thought the size of this game was a little on the high end. (above 10gb) but I gues for the age of it and the probable unnecessary programming for the time I cant complain to much. I just wish it had been a bit longer play time for the size.overall, now that I have the sound issue fixed, I found this to be an enjoyable title. Hovever for the age and play, I found the original farcry to be a much better more well thought out game, except for the 2 stupidly annoying boss battles. my oppinion if you want this game get it and you shouldnt regret it, but get the original farcry aswell and note the difference for yourself.\\nGarry\\'s Mod Is One Of My Favourite Games, With Lots Of Things To Do In Just Sandbox Alone, There Is Also Lots Of Custom Content Like : Dark RP, TTT And Flood With I Really Enjoy. Defently Worth $9.99\\n10/10 would get stuck again!\\nOne of the best games i have ever played this game is going down in my books for one of the best story games ever this game was so well thought and planned out the storyline really keeps making you get more and more curious this is a must have for all Telltale fans\\nOne of the Most Original and Wierd Game I have Ever PlayedGG-10/10\\nAmazing SIngle PLayer Game, kept me on the endge of my seat for the enitre time. Truly amazing. Buy it its worth it.\\nCool simple Multiplayer / Cooperative FPS game.Pass the whiskey!\\nGood game just needs more stuff in this game so please make so new stuff :))\\nI\\'ve stopped playing all other games.  My farm needs me.\\nAmazing game, full of original ideas for its time, epic story line with loads of side quests and hidden bosses. Between the story, the beautiful graphics, music score, and the insanely enthralling card game mini-game, Final Fantasy VIII does the series proud. This is the RPG that proves if you got a great story and solid characters it can still be a damn good game despite some glaring flaws. This is the best and most memorable game i have ever played, and everybody who loves RPG games will without doubt love this game. First laid eyes on this game on my 11th birthday, my dad got me a ps1 and this game. Grew up playing it. This was the game that would spark my love of gaming and the rpg genre. You probably think that you can\\'t trust my review since I\\'ll be blinded by nostalgia but I played this game again recently and loved it. Played, loved and obssessed on it as a child. Played, loved and obssessed on it as a manchild.It has a good mix of humor and seriousness, the combat system works well. This game is LONG, taking over 50 hours just to get to the middle of the game, if you haven\\'t played the game before. Must buy.\\nI\\'m so confused... I actually had funI thought it was gonna be a soulless cash-in but I actually enjoyed it.. It\\'s no Pac-Man World 2 but it\\'s far from terrible\\nYou don\\'t have to get this game. It\\'s not like it\\'s the greatest FPS of all time or anything. But have a think about it.\\nAte a chocolate bar, leg was fixed..... BEST GAME EVA\\nThis game is great\\nOne heck of a game, with some flaws TDU2 is unique. It\\'s sort of like Forza Horizon with better open-world and more realism. It\\'s got a racing storyline, with some open-world elements to allow you to explore the beautiful islands of Hawaii (no, not Kawaii) and later on in the game (spoiler)  Ibiza . It\\'s a console port that\\'s mostly well done but needs some peformance tweaks.  Pros   Good graphics Very good range of cars Large and I mean  LARGE  maps x 2  Hidden easter eggs (e.g wrecked cars, collect them all and you get a car Suprisingly decent upgrade and customisation sysem  Cons    Securom DRM is complete and utter ♥♥♥♥ Slight framerate drops Multiplayer is down quite often Unplayable with a keyboard and mouse Physics takes gettin used to No sequel as the company has been disbanded\\nmeow meow!\\nLOVE IT 100% xD saw it on youtube so i looked it up when i found it i got it an i new i would love it xD\\nAmazing game, very fun to fly around destroying things although the game deserves many more players. A map-making tool would be great!\\nSpec Ops is fantastic, it has an amazing story line I love it. Totaly worth it!\\nMuito divertido e emocionante.Um dos melhore FPS da atualidade\\nAn amazing game with great variations of planes and tanks, and even with over 300 ping, it feels like I don\\'t have any!

Its very very addictive.2. You can make any kind of game you want from an action zombie game to a simulation game about farms (god help us).3. Its very easy to understand: make games.4. Massive re-playability.5. Its cheap.6. Cuz i say you buy it.7. I rate 9/10\\nThis game is amazing because it has amazing graphics and I love third person shooters. Classic zombies.\\nGreat FPS game, would bang/10\\nIf you like metal slug type games, this one is damn good fun.\\ngreat game, loats of fun to play with your friends.\\nthis game is very addictive and well done even for an early access game in alpha. Starting off is quite frustrating unless you know what the hell youre doing (I had no idea what I was doing) random people were killing me and I was constantly dying of hunger, you will deffinately need to look at some YouTube tuts for this game if you want to spare yourself the grief. Highly reccomend Rust if youre into  games like Minecraft and StarForge, excellent progress from an excellent developer! 8/10 SON!\\ngreat game, but just need to add a actual story mode to the game. 7/10\\nthis game is the best game i have played\\n9/10 a good game to play if your bored and want to play a quick game\\nLovely story, however I wish Kojima was given more time, this had potential to be one of the greatest games in history - 9.5/10, would highly recommend.\\nIf you\\'re into civilization-building (note the lack of a \"Sid Meier\" or capital C in that phrase) game where you\\'re essentially given a few families and a handful of resources and expected to make them thrive, then this game is for you.  This isn\\'t an AoE-type game, or even a Civilization-type game, insofar as there are no competing factions who will attack you.  This is simply a population-focused survival game, and it\\'s a pretty good one at that.  I\\'m addicted.\\ni Have played Killing Floor for around 2-3 years straight, and only now am i getting a little bored of it. This creation from the unreal engine, is completley satisfying for a survival zombie game. ALTHOUGH it is not a traditional zombie survival game, its is still the funnest IF NOT THE BEST zed based game i have EVER PLAYED. THe pure comical action with the witty and slandish british comedy that riddles the game is fantastic, and the FPS mechanics are just perfect (although there are a few glitches in the system when changing weapons and such, but this is mainly due to the inferiority of the engine not that actual game, and they are quite bearable)The Visuals are decent, not fantasitic or amazing, but they will satisfy you, for the game itself makes up for that. \\nReally good game but it is from 2004 and it is fun to play.\\nKnights of Pen. And Paper! I tried to be witty there.Now, I\\'m not one to do really large reviews, but I can tell you this: Buy this game.A ton of people will go on and on about how it sucks, how it\\'s stupid, but it\\'s a really fun RPG game for those that are into the genre. And a lot of people have gone on to say that it\\'s just a time waster, but no, it\\'s more than that. Like an RPG game, it\\'ll take you into the story the best it can. It\\'s up to you, if you let it do it\\'s job or not.And as such, this took me to believe that not many people gave it that starting chance. The chance to change their lives forever.Now, you might be thinking I\\'m biased, and yeah, I am. I never got the chance to grow up with great games that were released on older gen consoles. Like the NES, the SNES, and even the Sega Mega Drive. I got to miss the truly astonishing ups and lows of gaming history. All because I\\'m a kid. So, when a game like this comes along, a game that does so well at giving the player a feel of the old world, I take it like it\\'s a van full of candy.But, TL;DR: Buy this game if you\\'re into the genre, you won\\'t regret it.\\nWub wub wub, Catch some gun!!! Everybody play Borderlands 2!~~~Best co-op game i played so far Epic Story and FPS with RPG experiences...Ruin my life...\\nThe graphic requirement is quiet high....my poor Geforce GTX 560 is spinning its life away....No matter! I just bought a GTX 980 just for the sake of this game, if this graphics card cant handle it, I\\'ll just smash my computer.\\nThis game is not just a Sandbox game as it has many gamemodes made by others etc, and because of this it promises hours of laughter, action & much more, and you will never get bored of it as there are so many of the afforementioned Gamemodes :3.\\nYeah Its Alright, Valve Just Needs To Work On The Variety Of Characters They Give Us Here, Surley Its Better Than More Modern FPS That We Have Seen (COD Ghosts, Battlefield 4) But That Little Bit More Variety Can Make This Game So Much More!\\nIf ninja in galaxy\\nWhilst at first I intentionally held off from purchasing this game (as many of my friends did not have it and the fact that its prior incarnation decided to wipe itself of save files several times) I decided to take the plunge into Borderlands 2 when two other friends decided to purchase it during a steam sale. Since then there has been no regret to buying this product, the graphics have greatly improved, the gameplay is tighter and faster paced and the humour is nearly original Portal level in my opinion with lots of clever quips and references that you have to really see and search for.There is one thing however that must be though of when purchasing this, make sure you have a friend to play it with because as with any game that requires a bit of grinding a friend goes a long way to seperating boredom from adventures into hilarity.A geniunely good game if you do not mind the occasional What the Heck!!!! moments from enemies.\\nfree to play doesn\\'t affect by how expensive your itemfun\\nits cool only if you play with your friends :)\\nA pointless DayZ mod story:I played this game endlessly for over a year, playing vanilla DayZ mod from mid-late 2013 to early 2014 when I moved to DayZ Epoch. On the quiet Epoch server, the next few months were a blast as I became a loyal member and moderator of the Redline Gamers community until it died down over late 2014.After all this I can tell you my time playing DayZ has been the most entertaining, often exhilarating, sometimes calming and unforgettable experiences I\\'ve had ever.There is nothing more stressing than going to loot a military base  in fear of a far ghillied sniper. Nothing more angering than your pilotting friend crashing your precious helicopter into a mountain because he was \"looking at the map\". Nothing more enjoyable than the memes, jokes, good times and friends I\\'ve made being part of a community here.Ive talked to many different people, made friends and heard stories. Witnessed many acts of great kindness and many acts of pure evil. And witnessed some of the most unreal situations and events that only this game, in all it\\'s realism and conplexity, could create.Whether you are genuinely trying to survive in the attempted realism of DayZ mod or gearing up a base with your friends to murder every other player in DayZ Epoch, this game is the right stuff. Two years on I still remember some of the things that happened in this game and people I\\'ve met. Arma and its mods are titled as realistic simulators, and the memories of this game I have are VERY real\\nI Like Geometry Dash Because Of How Challenging It Is\\nYeah this game is awesome,I love it so much i will play once a week or 2 times lol\\nThs game needs a offline pratice mode where you can freely choose mercs to try them before you buy them and of course to test and improve on your skills\\nGood game!\\n10/10 PonyRP...

O.o* also very likely to run into the same team you are playing are in singleplayer and most of the time it\\'ll hate you *of course hate it\\'s self?* game is weird, funny, a little buggy (of course still fairly new game), but all up fun even in single player unlike other 4x stratergy games which get boring in single player quickly. recommend buying it but like all game not perfect but still get it if u like 4x stratergies, and fantasy (but can be a bit anoying when a quest tells u to declare war on an ally T_T luckly ai in this can be forgiving)\\nMoneyMoney is all I ever need\\nThis is the game one would get by crossing the elements of Pure sandbox gameplay and RPG gameplay. In other words, you are free to do what you want while building up your character to suit your gameplay.In essence this game can be played any way you prefer, but it\\'s best played with a few friends.\\nit\\'s all and nothing at the same time... Either way, I enjoy that.\\nDont underestimate it just cause its in alpha, its a good game now and will be a GREAT game in the future keep doin wat you doin fun pimps :S\\nThis game has surprised me before I thought it was bad so I didn\\'t get it and now I just tried and I am in love with this game.Suprisingly It nearly reached the level to counter strike global offensive besides the graphics,year and different  game modes.However this game is very casual like Team fortress 2.If you have experience in Csgo and CsSource will be very easy as they ar pretty much the same.However this game might need to improve a bit in the model of how you play.So in my opinion I think this game should be a must have for casual players not sure about competitive.So thumbs up I reccomend this game\\nPromotes good Religious Values 100/100Get it\\nRevolutionary.\\n\"Pass the whiskey\" 10/10\\nCiv 5 what more can I say... \\nVery Fun 9/10\\nexcelente juego, para pasar el rato, muy bueno, pocos requeriminetos, descarga rapida y mucho tiempo de diversion asegurada, y puedes matar hipsters, lo recomiendo 100%  graficas extilo antiguo, y es F2P, aunque costara 10 usd lo compraria.\\nEuropa Universalis IV is a game in which you choose a nation that existed from late 1444 to the early 1800\\'s. There is no real way to win the game, instead allows to to choose what you want to do. Invade Germany as Poland. Conqueror Europe as France. Colonise Australia as Russia. The list goes on and on. Many people buy this game believing that it will be the same or similar to the 4X style of games (Explore, Expand, Exploit, and Exterminate) and ending up not liking this game. If you believe this, I would not recommend this title due to you. Otherwise I would recommend Europa Universalis to you.\\n10/10 would become a toilet again.\\nthis game is a tower defence game and you should get if\\nFun,Simple and hey is anyone getting hungry\\nthis game is fun\\nthis is a very addictive game to play even more addictive when you play online with friends and build a community i rate this game 9/10\\nit is a realy good game if you can actully run it on your cpu (i cant i get 3 fps )\\nFeel OP as you smash through 500 bad guys while you try and figure out what to do for the mission\\nIn space...

Got them all to sign a peace treaty build up a army took over a castle and then I made the Nord faction rule the world.. got married to the jarl\\'s daughter and the only war that did happen was a bandit war!... Gameplay is outstanding 10/10. I would of liked it if there was a conquest mode in muliplayer so loads of people could take over parts of the map....

And there\\'s Co-op too.\\nthis games is one of the most let ur self go games\\nOne of the best arcade games I\\'ve ever played. The movement is absolutely spot on. Well worth the money.

The character customizeation proves to help you make a unique character and vehicle.But there some downsides in which i should mention...1. No sign of australian servers. 2, because the stock weapons are newbie-friendly. But the stock weapons on APB reloaded is just, No... Overall, these are just badsides, the customizeations is something deffinately worth playing this game for.i\\'d say 5/10. If you have spare time, give this game a ride.\\nI havent played this game for as long as i would like but this game is very good for a game that came out in 2006. The graphics arent the best but the gameplay is great. This game runs on any peice of crap which is great. This game also brings lots of nastolgia.\\nI recommend that you download this game because it is a very addicting game and it has a variety of weapons ,DLCs and character customizations .I also enjoy this game because you get to play with your friends and it gets hard and extremely epic when people join .\\nNormally don\\'t care for Comic titles however it was the Art Direction of this game that got me into it. Despite the dreadful launch the title has since been majoratively fixed. The game is enjoyable, the stories interesting and engaging. I would highly recommend it, definitely worth its value.

No matter how tough you think you are, this game softens you to the core. This game is positively one of my favourite games ever made. Despite the short lenght and somewhat easy puzzles, this game focuses on the story which is a truly beautifully written one. 10/10 don\\'t know how many more times I would play this but I could forever.\\nFreakin awesome \\nUnturned is a great game it\\'s a mix of Minecraft and DayZ, It is a really fun game in single player but multi player is even better you can build things or you can be a murderer of zombies and people.Unturned is a great game and it is a great Free to play game.\\nSo simple yet so fun, this game will make you love it and hate it.

And then do whatever you want... and I mean anything. It\\'s that good.\\nBest zombie game ever made\\nA good game, though its missing the \"Free Ride\" feature from the previous game. I give it 5/10\\nThis game.. Its fricken Amazing. If you want to be the badass, you play this game. Wild Western Themed with Intense gameplay. Your enemies arn\\'t Flies, They\\'re people, you can\\'t just squash them, They go down with a fight. You may think this game is 2ez4u, but trust me, try it, and you will think differently. This game is the one that you come to when there is nothing to play, the MEGA DOWNFALL is that, its community is dead, there is only about 12 people on. I sat on that game, for 20 minutes on computer, and there was not a single player. On PS4 its alive with a community. We just need more players and you will realise that this game is fun, and not some stoopid game that no one plays. We need just 1 thing to push it up to the surface, and reach 100players at the least, so we can show people this game is awesome!                         So lets notify our friends, to tell their friends to tell their friends, to get this game..\\nWant a sandbox that allows you to murderize every manmade structure?

Recomended for survival and horror interested gamers.\\nShould buy this for the music and humour alone, 10/10\\nA very punishing yet rewarding game only 2 difficulties very easy or easy don\\'t be fooled however as the difficulty ramps up very quickly.\\nBuy It Girls\\nKilling floor is a wave based zombie shooter with 8 different types of zombies/mutants and a player limit of 6 or so (many more on modded servers though). Game play is basic you pick a perk (Demolitions (grenade launchers and my fav), Support (shotgun and welder), Sharpshooter (pistols and rifles), Berserker (Melee weapons), Pyro (flame based weapons), Medic (Obvious), Commando (Assault rifles). You can purchase weapons of any class at the end of a wave at a trader which is open for a variable amount of time based on settings. In addition to your weapons every class has a medic gun and a welder (both work only at melee range) but their effectiveness is based on your perk. You can weld certain doors and gates closed letting you hold off the horde that little while longer. Guns sound awesome, a decent variety for each class. You are limited by a weight limit for how many weapons you can carry though (not by slots). The base game has quite a few maps including a couple of objective maps as well as a few sandbox settings and difficulty levels. The base game is quite fun for the first few weeks but starts to get samey/grindy which is why i HIGHLY recommend to play on a modded server. There is also a lot of things on the workshop page (especially modded maps) which i also recommend checking out too. The workshop is why i kept playing from 30 hours onward. The game also has holiday orientated events (Halloween redneck zombies, evil Santa)Graphics are okay (game is a couple of years old) and it is very gory with no geo block :D. Which is why the demo class is so fun XD. Sounds are pretty good, guns feel nice (especially the 9mm). Maps vary from open, outdoors, corridors, small e.c.t so there is a lot of variety there. That about sums up KF, its simple but fun. I would recommend it (especially on sale), it also is still receiving updates. (Don\\'t think i forgot anything).\\nThe best game\\nmajestic huge sandbox game i recomend it sooo much\\nFun quirky game - reminds me of nethack for some weird reason.Looks simple but is really quite difficult.\\nIt is a decent game. Gameplayi is solid. Unlike Minecraft or other games of its caliber, its more based on survival. It has multiple playable characters and steam workshop. It may get old but its still a lot of fun. They also update it once in a while to keep it interesting.\\nClover\\'s hair physics. 10/10\\ngood game once you get past the bugs then the story gets interesting and so on just like the first game but with a few twists\\nLove it to bits!\\nIf you didn\\'t already notice, this game\\'s concept is loosely based off of the Maximum Overdrive movie in the 80\\'s. Except in this game, you get to play as the machines taking over the world. The gameplay is fun, and very satisfying. The visuals are nice. They are somewhat akin to that of Katamari Damacy. As of right now, there are only 3 modes, all of which have different goals (Did not get to play the Sandbox Mode when I tried the game, but it\\'s basically like the other modes, just with no goal). In arcade mode, you try to destroy as much as possible, to score as high as possible within 3 minutes. In Gman elimination mode, you must destroy a certain number of MIB (Men In Black) before the time runs out. Overall, the game was fun, and should get better with more refining whilst in early access. The only gripe I have with the game, is that the controls feel a little strange, mainly when operating the camera when you aren\\'t in a vehicle, and are searching for one to control on the map. Overall though, i would recommend this game :)If you\\'re interested, i made a video on the game, which i\\'ve put below.\\nWhat can I say about Just Cause 2to do it justice? Absolutely nothing. It is literally everything an open-world should be. Yeah, maybe the GTAs have had more sales, but this will always be the best carjacking open-world game. It combines all the gripping gameplay of GTA, with a far more gripping and compelling storyline. And grappling hook. That thing can do anything.\\nLet\\'s start off with something, this game is amazing.When you first start off in the game your going to be put in a Battlefeild/Counter strike enviroment, choosing between two teams (Insurgency or Security), you will be faced with a detailed loadout selection and class selection. Each class on each team has access to different guns, attachments etc. And you have a set amount of equipment tokens/points to spend on your loadout. You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering \"should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead\". From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can\\'t really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps. Insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more (also teamwork is a thing in this game).\\ni enjoy this game for one sole purpose: It\\'s fun, and a game hard to forgeti recamend this game.\\nit is good\\nVery relaxing + free. Great combination.\\nO_O\\nIts a fun game but i don\\'t like the points system in the game, kind of takes the fun out of it being a classic hitman game\\n10/10 would shogun\\nI would recommend this to multiple people if you like minecraft and sandboxes\\nJust one of my favourite games :D\\nGood when you have all of the expansion packs.\\nThis is one of the best games that I have ever owned. It never gets old, I always find myself going back to play this classic. It has kept me entertained for many hours! Would highly recommend to anyone.\\nIncredibly fun, in a category of its own.\\nMy god I love this game. I\\'m not sure what the entire game is like because I only played Karin\\'s story but I loved it to bits. The entire plot is great and is super heart warming. You really start to warm up to the characters and I wouldn\\'t be surprised if people actually started having full fledged crushes on some of the main characters. It gets a little bit boring at times but it was probably just me being impatient. I\\'m gonna get my friends to check out this game because every time I play it makes me fell so happy it\\'s crazy. It would make me the happiest person ever if you made  a sequel where you go back to live with them after either breaking up with the one you chose or continuing the story with the relationship still going. Either way I would love to see some sort of follow up. You have my full support the whole way. (Also can I just say that the soundtrack is amazing and I would\\'ve loved to here some more songs with lyrics or just somewhere I can get the mp3s to this game because I would listen to them every day) It would probably ruin the point of the story but I would love to see this english dubbed one day. I would replay the entire game.\\nthis game is fun but nobody ever wants to play with me ;;\\nHours of fun!\\nA great game one of the best stories (maybe even the best). I love the simplicity of Thomas Was Alone, I\\'ve replayed it several times and each time its is still as amazing. I heard once that a game with hours and hours of gamplay is better then one with only 4 or 5 hours, but this is not true. Sometimes a story is told better in a few hours than a week. An awesome sound track and many loveable characters. There should be more games like this.Thomas Was Alone Awesome\\nGreat psychological thriller! The game itself revolves more around survival and exploration, leaning towards adventure than other titles. Gives nods to all the great suspense writers of all time, its just Remedy in true fashion with hints of max payne showing through from time to time. \\ngood game highly recommend getting it\\nBrilliant game , had lots of fun and good memories with it.\\nWait, why did i just spend 1 hour breaking my keyboard to be eventually friend zoned by this game?10/10 Neckbeard Simulator, would do in real life.\\nITS AN AWESOME GAME >:) :3 <3\\nSome of the most fun you could have on a game!

If you want proof of what I am saying, try the game for yourself\\nthis game is so god dam finished it has less bugs then many tripple A games that get realeased now day (im looking square at you unity) but to be fair thier are balance issues with certin layouts being the optimal stratagy and also the dev has said that the drugs feature hasent realy got the effect on your prisons he would like to see. but still this game is rich in content and if you have any enjoymnent for sim like games were you set the peramiters and see how the AI reacts to it, your going to loose potentialy hundreads of hours.\\nTHIS So good games!! :b\\nlike a stealthy ninja but with high tech suit and guns\\nits just relly fun\\nI never knew i could get crazy by hats\\nDrill simulator: Survival mode\\nThis game is epic! good graphics, good guns,rides and good thinking of perks for each class i rate this 28129812798217/10\\nNeed a waifu?You need this game then.\\nPRETTY AMAZING-IM TALKING TO U OSCAR\\nVery nice when you play with a friend or even alone although meta score is 60+\\nthis is a mental challenging game that breaks all the laws of physics ?\\nOverall Content = very good.

Great game!\\nThis game is great, 10/10 I love this game mainly becasue it puts you in the shoes of a real time futuristic soldier. The combat in this is exceptional and is very realistic.

It\\'s simplistic design and easy controls makes this game easy to pick up and play. The difficulty of the stages progress at the same pace as your ability and there are very few levels I find too easy or too difficult. If you have $5 in your steam account, I recommend you prioritise this game over any other item of the same price.\\nThis game is EPIC!!!so fast GET IT!!!!!!!:D\\nAmazing, so fun to play with friends.\\nWhat an epic following to the original DOTA.

I tried to keep playing through the noise but then I heard the announcers god awful australian accent which led to my nose and eyes bleeding as well. So unfortunately instead of paying for this game I spent my money in hospital bills.

EVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH <3333\\nThe Forest is an open-world survival horror game. It is in its alpha stage and with comes a bunch of bugs but this game is FREAKING FUN, its is also very freaking hard that is if your just starting out like I am. Althought the game isnt much at the moment, if the developers keep going at it, iron out the game breaking bugs this game will turn out to be one of the best survival games of ALL-TIME and I highly recommend it.\\nas soon as you get into the game you have so much fun just with the movement system :D.\\nExcellent game and deserves Game of the Year. Reminds me of Fallout alot but is different in its own way. The graphics are unique and work well since it is consistent throughout the game.\\nA very balanced zombie shooter, And good quality x3!\\ngreat game first ten minsfoodhealthmore healthand more health(needs more healthgeting a diamond oregeting two gold oresthen dieing painfully\\nTHIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!\\nGreat time consuming game, a game you can totally immerse yourself in , with only the  Slight catch of a light wallet. I absolutely love this game, it provides a great challenge, while making it fun and enjoyable. This is one of the few games that requires the player to have a strong tactile intuition, and good communication with your comrades, that is absolutely essential for an enjoyable game. At first you laugh at people spending money on this game, next minute you\\'re drawing blood from a stone, and bam, all your cash is gone. That is the only catch. Lightwallet/10 would pay again. Anyhow, defiantly check this bugger out, bloody worth it.\\nit\\'s alright\\nI have played so many Free to Play games, but so far this is the only example of how good a F2P game could be.  Replayability :- 7/10  Constant updates :- 10/10  Events every month :- 10/10  Dev\\'s interaction with players :- 9/10  Real F2P aspect :- 9/10  Inevntory management :- 3/10  At the start of the game you are given all heroes to play for free until they reach level 10, level 60 is max for unlocked heroes. Once you are done deciding which hero you want you can unlock 1 hero for free to lvl it to 60 (I suggest taking Deadpool 1st, since he has no energy cost and is fun to play).   Everytime you play the game, the game will drop Eternity Splinters for you to pick up, don\\'t ignore them. You can use those Eternity Splinters to buy more heroes from the \\'Eternity Splinter\" vendor. You don\\'t need to spend real/steam money for playing the game. The only thing you can might need to spend money is the costumes, but random costumes can be crafted too when you do Prestige. Prestige is releveling a hero from 0 to 60 once again, everytime you prestige you get a original costume of a hero, you can use 3 of the original costumes to craft 1 random costume.  There is atleast 1 event going on every month which will keep you hooked up to the game. The devs make sure the events are glitch-free.  The only thing I don\\'t like about this game is that the default inventory is too short, and the Eternity Splinter price of STASH is also too high (600 Splinters) which takes long time to aquire compared to Random hero unlock box (175 Splinters).  Overall rating for the game :- 8/10\\nfun\\nA trinkle of RED!\\nfinally got 100% on this game, I would highly recommend the game, has an amazing and unique graphical style even those who aren\\'t fans of the series can pickup the game quickly and enjoy gameplay that never seems to get boring with such an exciting pace\\nLOL.

This is a Space Marine arcade game. A very FUN Space Marine arcade game. There are four classes to play as, co-op play for two players, a variety of weapons, and useful perks for your marine. The voice acting is excellent- the space marine commander who gives you orders is perfect, and serves to immerse you in the universe thoroughly. It truly feels (in spite of it\\'s arcade style) like the grim darkness of the far future- I will be playing this game a lot in the future. For all 40k fans dissappointed in Games Workshop in recent years: this is a genuine piece of the wonderful and terrible galaxy we\\'ve all come to know and love. A single perfectly crafted Space Marine mission. You\\'ll be glad you played it.\\nI haven\\'t experienced this game much, but what I\\'ve experienced was great.

Requiring good communication, strong game sense and excellent control of weapon recoil and spray control, Counter-Strike : Global Offensive is a fun yet challenging experience!\\nOddly for me the appeal of this game is that I can play it solo after a day at work and just slowly work my way through levels. L4D did the same thing but I love the melee combat in this one. Definitely more fun and fast paced with friends, so I guess I\\'m a bit different.\\nSexiest game ever\\nAbsolute perfection of a game that onlt just came out of beta, I played it for the first time and it was the best and I played in that beta so thx allot Grinding Gear Games for the AMAZBALLZ game!\\nThis game projects a similar atmosphere to that of Portal 2. Puzzles both simple and complex, a very institution-like environment and an almost complete lack of storyline or context that leaves you wondering at the very end: \"Wait... what?\"A brilliant game that is well worth the money.\\ngreat game for people who love building, flying and smashing stuff. i guess you could say its a little like minecraft as you place down sqaure blocks but dont think that the games bad now because it\\'s not. this games is perfect for the right people but if you dont like waiting and dont want to build you can simply go download a mod from the workshop.i hope you get this game in the future and if you do have fun!!\\nNot buying this game is a SHAMEFURR DISPRAY.10/SHAMEFURR DISPRAY\\nThis game is very fun and is very challenging which makes it funnier so i recommend to buy to get this game Best Third person shooter i played in my life\\nI\\'ve been very suprised with this game, even in its curent form it\\'s a whole lot of fun.

The simulation aspect of this game is beautiful, you actually feel like you are in control of a real-life train! There\\'s also a world builder, but it seems like you need to be smarter than I to work that labyrinth of hell. Good game if you just wanna drive.\\nawesome\\nBorderm Buster.\\nThis game is amazing for anyone looking for a survival based game other than the stereotypical Minecraft-type game.\\nGreat game, good to play something other than FPS or RTS. The comic-like aesthetic is good but I think it takes away from the grim setting and dramtic performance in this game, though have photorealistic graphics would up development times and costs. Great story quite similar to Last Of Us in a few ways.The complaints about the level of influence your decisions have in the story are made by people expecting too much. This isn\\'t developed by some AAA studio with a megabudget, the narrative follows the same pattern as the Mass Effect series, you end up in the same place with a slight variation in who you are, who is around you and what happen outside of the core story.The 400 Days DLC is quite a good filler between seasons 1 & 2.\\nOne of the best VR games out there! 10/10\\ncan we get dank memes stickers on our cars\\nloads of fun and easy to mod\\nreally nice work on the remaster\\nTactical genital poking.10/10Looking forward to online multiplayer.\\nA nice little RTS that is essentially a stand alone expansion  to 8 Bit Armies. With a total of 4 factions to chose from now (assuming you also have 8 Bit Armies) the 8-bit experience is definately much deeper  than before with larger selections of units and strategies. Military vs Fantasy is also pretty cool. I do believe however, the game is a little unbalanced (eg mass air ), but that is to be expected as the game has just come out. There are also a few typos here and there (eg the tech trees). It would also be pretty cool if we could still have the 8-Bit Armies music in the game when the original factions are selected. If 8-Bit Armies\\' support was anything to go by, I\\'m sure Petroglyph will give 8-Bit Hordes the same treatment with constant tweaks and updates.Definately reccomended for fans of RTS or anyone who is looking for a more laid back experience.\\n\"this is how you died\" WOW, thanks game for destroying my self confidence ...11/10 Would make a sandwich again\\nThis game will take everything you have learnt from other first-person shooters and add so much more. The sheer amount of skills and tactics which any good player must learn in order to succeed is breathtakingly immense, AND if you don\\'t wish to learn anything, and play like it\\'s Call Of Dogshit, then the silver ranks welcome you with open arms! glhf\\nI\\'m just here to play with mods\\nThe Walking Dead is a spinoff comedy from the hit movie 50 Shades of Grey. Starring PewDiePie and Jack Black, it follows the events of Professor Oak from the Final Fantasy franchise as he stumbles through Hyrule to slay the Dragon Warrior. This album features many mix tapes that will have you jammin\\' to dem beats for days to come. This game had me in hysterical fits of laughter for hours upon completion. Jupiter Ascending is a fantastic book with a moral to be learnt. \"The power of the Dragon Warrior was inside of you the whole time.

Mission settings such as \"onsluaght mode\" makes things interesting in the sense that you can have it off and run through the missions as intended and take your time, or turn it on to penalize slow movement due to massive hoardes that... well swarm... you every minute whether you move or not. Vast types of aliens keeps you on your toes and its a game thats overall pretty simple to learn (also has offline practice that offers hints or for you to test different load outs which is fun), then if you havent played in a while you can get right back into it, just like riding a bike\\nSo fun to play with or without friends... GET IT!!!\\nIf i didnt know any better, i\\'d play this and think Russia, Indonesia and South America have taken over the world.\\nPuzzle horror games always beat with story line. This game MUST be played at night with low lighting to create better scary atmosphere. The game gets less scary as you understand how to kill the dogs and spiders. Its a game that kempt me on my wits with parts tobe slow and stelthy and some that require a good, \"arh,,, run!\"One game i will not forget anytime soon.\\nso guns so heavy so wow\\nI suck at this game, but it is pretty fun.\\nGreat MMORPG. For me, it was my first experience with a game like this. Mainly because it was 3D. :3 Don\\'t judge me. Anyways, it was a beautiful game with fast and stylish combat as well as vivid characters and decent humour. I suggest you give it a try until the end. The main problems for me when playing is that, the game is quite slow and tedious. At the beginning, of course this shows the most but as you progress through, entering each area and doing each quest was indeed slow. It was worthwhile though because you were awarded with rewards. I still recommend this game for all ages. I have friends playing this game from as young as 10 to 30 xD. 8.5/10 Great combat and story.\\nThis would have to be one of the best Early Access titles that I purchased. Being a big fan of the original installment, when I heard about the second installment, I was excited. Did this game manage to live up to the excitement? Yes, Definitely! The only \"flaw\" currently that I have found is the lack of content, BUT! This game is in Early Access and more content will obviously be added. From the (as of 24/04/2015) 4 hours that I spent playing this game, both solo and with friends, I feel like this game has incredible promise.The good:*Visuals - This game\\'s visuals are stunning. The graphics have received a very nice upgrade from this game\\'s predecessor, without taking away from the style that the first game portrayed.*Performance - This game has very good optimization. I was able to run the game on medium to high on my low end PC and still manage a stable 60fps, with only a few ocassional drops.*Gore - The gore system got a massive overhaul, which just makes it so much more satisfying to blow the heads off of Zeds and watch it literally explode, spraying everything in blood. Each Zed has a huge amount of points of dismemberment, so you can quite literally tear them limb for limb.*UI - The user interface got some heavy tweaking compared to the first game, making everything more sleek and easy to access. The Vendor Pod has a very nice interface as well, with everything laid out infront of you without having to scroll down or across.*Classes - Although only 4 of the classes are available at this point in time, the skills/class perks feel rewarding for the effort you put in. *SDK - The game has been noted to have the SDK and community creations implemented later on in development, which is great, as I found the community creations one of the best parts of the first game.*Humour - That\\'s right, the wonderful British banter from the first game makes a comeback, better than ever. I mean who doesn\\'t love British people insulting zombies. :P*Dosh - Aww yis, the dosh now has physics! You can literally make piles of money. When encountered with large crowds, it can be quite annoying being spun around every couple of seconds having to bash a zed away, only to be grappled by another one and spun around. I personally preferred the grappling from the first game, where they just slow down your movement, until you can\\'t move.*Servers - I\\'m giving the game credit with this one, but I\\'m just going to list it here for the time being, since I consider it a negative part. (At this point in time). Currently the servers that are available are almost all full, with only a few with much higher latency being available. All of the ones with great ping and empty are privated however. This wouldn\\'t be too much of a problem, but as of this point in time, the method for creating a dedicated server for the game is quite tedious. >Also, I\\'m not sure if this is a glitch, but 90% of the time, when a game is finished I am often sent back to the main menu screen, even on my friend\\'s game<All in all, if you\\'re a fan of the original installment, I\\'d highly recommend picking this up. If you\\'re a bit sceptical about purchasing games that are in Early Access, I\\'d probably suggest giving this one a miss until the price drops for a sale, as there currently isn\\'t too much content. If you\\'ve never played the first game in the franchise, but you\\'re interested in Zombie Survival games, such as Left 4 Dead, I recommend giving this game a try. I can definitely see myself sinking more hours into this game as it develops.\\nIf you start playing Competitive mode 5 vs 5, its over, no other MP FPS will matter to you.Still my favorite FPS Multiplayer series.\\nsweet/10\\nThis is an incredibly relaxing game featuring an amazing soundtrack and great gameplay. A must for people who just want to relax. But like most games it has its flaws. It gets a little repetative but then again, I am not a peaceful kind of person. 9/10\\nGG\\nBest game ever. 10/10\\nPersonaly my favorite game in the Crysis series solely because of how the nanosuit works. Being able to actively switch between the four different suit mods alows you to instantly adapt to changing situations, add on the instant weapon customisation  and you get one of the most dynamic shooters out there. Still remember one  of my favorite moments in gaming is when i punched a truck into a Korean soldier nocking him flat on the ground only for his buddy to accidentaly shoot the gas tank and blow him up.All in all a great sandbox to endlessly fight an intelligent and tough enemy.*NOTE*(this game dosn\\'t run on some versions of windows. So look into that before you purchase) \\nFair warning, this is a VERY tongue in cheek game similar to GTA, if you haven\\'t got a sense of humour then this isn\\'t the game for you.I bought this in the \\'Saints Row Ultimate Franchise Pack\\' when it was on special and I must say, this is the BEST purchase I have made on Steam so far (this game marks my 43rd game I have played via Steam at the time of writing).I enjoyed the GTA series games but looking back on them I would have to say I enjoyed this more.  I can say the same for the Far Cry series too.  I suppose I could add Just Cause to the list it beats but I have only played 3 hours of JC2 after getting a little tired of it, the same can\\'t be said for SR3 though, it made me want to come back for more and more!Saints Row 2 was indeed a poor port in the fact that driving was fairly hard as the game played at an increased speed.  Saints Row 3 look excellent though and I encountered no problems (yet to play Co-op though).The activities are extremely fun, enough to replayable for the enjoyment of them.I look forward to playing SR4 soon!\\nI\\'ll give this game a 9/10.-One of the best C.O.D\\'s I\\'ve played so far. Yes it has FPS lag on a few maps like Defender or Instict but only for a minute or two,after that the game is fine. -This game is heeps of fun with some friends in a private,online match,or just on your own playing online!-Storyline is AMAZING!-Bunch of new gamemodes like Uplink,Momentum Etc.-I Really recommend this game! \\nworst western shooter, not even horses or cowboy hats. has op revolver20/10 ign\\nAt first I found this game a bit challenging, but after a bit of getting used to I have found it easier and is one of my favourite games of all time, recently I have been playing heaps and the community is a lot friendlier behind this game aswell, example at the end of a CS:GO game \\'gg\\' at the end of a CoD game \\'You fkn suck go to hell\\'. The game is well made and the continuous content updates are great, a good thing that separates Golbal Offensive from Source is the new guns and the weapon skins for each gun giving you the ability to have cooler looking guns, and more importantly StatTrak which gives players who can afford it the ability to count their kills. The micro-transactions in this game are not forced onto you but it is a good way to gamble, like if you spend $20 on an unboxing and get a $120 knife from it you made profit, or you lose money (that is why it\\'s gambling), and the operations which give you earlier access to community made maps and keep a personal record of your competitive scores. This game is one of the best First Person Shooters out there and I\\'d give it a 9/10. The EMS competitions give players the chance to try get their name out there in the CS:GO community and also win big cash, and for those who are not a good enough player who can\\'t assemble a team it is great fun to wath.\\nA beautiful game with a soundtrack to remember\\nnice\\nVery Tactics, much stratergy, so aliens ultimate respect source matirael. WOW\\nDo you want to rush into battle with your sword with absolutely no training at all...Well, Chivalry: Medieval Warfare allows you to do exactly that.. enjoy the sounds of warcries and the clashing of swords with this ultimate experience.If you get hit in the knee with an arrow, report to bethesda... they deal with you.

This is basically a smaller lmg, which is great because you get to use iron sights and don\\'t have to worry about movement speed as much, while still having the room clearing potential, the accuary is rather low to begin with but can be easily modded to increase to a reasonable amount.                              The Anarchist perk.                 Replace some of your health with armour, regain armor from killing enimies. This perk deck is great because it can essentially let you become a\"mini tank\", being able to have heaps of armor but still being really mobile.                The Wing Butterfly knife.        Pretty average melee, same stats as most other knives but has a awsome charge animation.                Sydney. I love this character, i know people might find her high pitched voice annoying, but i like it. Maybe it\\'s because i\\'m australian but i don\\'t mind the accent. Easily my favorite female heister.             Overall the sydney character pack is probably one of the better character packs out there would reccomend.\\nto everyone out there this is a very great game and in its early stages aswell i can hardly find any bugs im sure there must be a few and it has the potential to be a extremly thrilling experience\\nOne of the best PVP shooter I have played in the past few years.Btw free maps and operators for everyone?

No arguing that.I can say without hyberbole This is the unquestionable Lovechild of Warchunder, kerbal, microsoft flight simulator, robocraft, and every sandbox build games ever made. and this is better than all of them.Completely boundryless when they say the skys the limit there is no better game than this.  if it flies you can build it helicopters and certain time period planes, sweep winged planes cannards. the only down side is call it that with the game is there is no multiplayer yet, and The non diagetic guitar music will make your ears ring after a hour or so, but that can be muted. everyone whos calling the game bad must be deported to the middle east to see the definition of bad. And let me just say this game is and always will one of the best purchases i made since Garry\\'s mod since they are games like this cannot possibly be bias and the Devs will actually let you have a voice!

Kingston HyperX Beast 16.0 GB OS.Microsoft Windows 8.1, 64-bit Upgrading my GTX760 soon to a new GTX970 (about 2ish weeks away)Will update my review when It\\'s installed & I\\'ve played it.I wish there was more than Yes/No for review Early Access games, but so far if you can tweak the graphics right I recommend this over other early access survival games.Thanks for reading.Deatheffekt.Update #1 Patch 171.511 Hours mostly all in game I doubt even an hour is in the menu/server list, and I honestly say if you can get this running get it, I\\'ve loved every second of it.The updates since day one have been great, the game runs way better for me atleast and looks amazing, the hard work the dev\\'s are doing will pay off, and I honestly see this being finished one day if they keep doing this.\\nTiss good. Spent a long time running around looking for various lords.420/10 Would listen to jigga again\\nDarksouls Scholar of the First Sin   Darksouls Scholar of the First Sin  was ment to be 20x harder I only found it a bit harder then the original but  in the ways they made it harder they also made it easier. New players just picking up darksouls 2 Scholar of the First Sin will have a hard time because the enemies just swarm you its not 1 enemy then 1 enemy etc etc like it was in darksouls 2. OVER ALL SCORE  Hardness   7.5/10 - Much more difficult with the addition of more NPC invades altho they removed a lot of features from 2 (to try and balance it out). Players that are new to darksouls (Haven\\'t player the other 2) will find this really hard  Enjoyment  8/10 - I had a lot of fun playing thing over it was fun knowing that the enemies were in different places  and i didnt really know what to expect. Allt hough it was still darksouls 2 but changed it a bit more so not as fun as picking up a new souls game and doing a blind run\\nI like humor! XD5/5 for a $1 indie game :)\\nthis game rocks!\\nVery good and has great potential for mods\\nGreat Game. I spend to much time building bases.\\nThis game is AWESOME!!!Buy it now!!But, you must have 3 good, best or close friends that play this game. Because, this game is really need to have a really good teamwork. Or not, the heist will be fail.\\nEPIC GAME\\nFun and puzzling and a kind of story related thing is starting to evolve, but it is definately lacking in story.\\nthis is a beautifuly designed game which seems to build on and even supass that basic framework of the TelTale games.aside from the differant graphics style, what sets this game apart is the characters interaction with the world, less point and click, more second person RPG. thi sis a destinct advantage in my opinion over the much loved teltale game series\\'.beautifuly designed, great 3D movement, great story :D :D :D\\nMuito divertido no coop.Quem tem me chama pra jogar. xD\\nDO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE THE DAY ISN\\'T LONG ENOUGH?

PERSONIFY LITTLE TRIANGLES AND ABHOR ANYTHING WITH MORE THAN THREE SIDES. THIS GAME WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.\\nAmazing game. Sooo much fun !! 10/10 would bang again i mean play again ;)\\nGreat game but lags alot\\nThe best game that has come out in the past 10 years.\\nSo I am no veteran to salt, however I am a veteran towards sandbox titles in general, I have literally been scouring the web and steam for a game that can stand out from the rest with something players all love and crave while giving a new feel. I can honestly say that SALT has really done an incredible job the Dev\\'s I take my hat off to.What I cannot believe is that I was just in time to see some real development in the game, as I began playing SALT just before this update was released, so I was able to see the ship models and textures before. after the update I was blown away by its detail upgrade. Highly recommend SALT and can only assume the best of its potential.I would say 10/10 but as I am only 2 hours in, I will have to give 8/10 until my excitement and enthusiasm dies down. Then my rating can be more accurate and see clearer.first 2 hours of gaming10mins - running running oh a chest12mins - reading craft manual14mins - boat.... i need a boat23mins - i have a boat =D30mins - sailing sailing sailing =D31mins - gathering materials from island to island50mins - spot an abandoned ship51mins - board the abandoned ship52mins - notice i can repair, but do not have materials1 hour 40mins - have materials and repaired pirate ship2 hours - sailing on my pirate ship not caring where I am going just going.looks to repair and own a bigger pirate ship\\nIf your one of those people that think there is too much DLC for this game. Go to Train Simulator 2015 on Steam\\nSuch a fun little minigame that it growing fast and I love it. I find myself playing it when I have spare time. It is especially fun with friends.\\nOk, so lets get a few things straight, and excuse my spelling. Dungeon Defenders 2 has essentially become P2W in a way. it\\'s also become pretty grindy, but it is still a fun game. Sure it has many flaws and bugs, but if you can ignore them, it\\'s actually quite enjoyable, although the time it takes to buy the Abyss lord is horrible, withought buying Defender Medals ( if you can that is) and jsut farming Betty, it would take atleast 120 hours or more, just to get him. Still, I would reccomend trying it out, you might hate it, you might love it, but it is still fun.\\ndon\\'t listen to the narrow minded, cretens who say the game is bad. This is a supurb example of 21st centuary RTS gaming at its best. easily my best RTS game of 2011 \\nYou don\\'t play a game for over 600 hours without knowing it\\'s good.\\nThis games is full o\\' swag\\nBrilliant. Absolutely Brilliant. A Must Buy.\\n\"ok, so I go down here, and.. no, that\\'s not right. maybe if I go back I\\'ll... wait.. that\\'s not right either... what if I do this instead? no.. that didn\\'t work.. ok surely this time I can... oh. nevermind.\"Antichamber:The most mindebending puzzle game you have ever seen. Not particularly difficult as a puzzle, but until you work out how the game works you will stay very confused about everything that is happening.also I now have a headache so there\\'s that.\\nWhat are these people talking about, I don\\'t understand!There is not ONE massive problem I found in No Man\\'s Sky and I had no lag spikes AT ALL in my whole entire playthrough.These people who whine about the game being laggy and all must have Windows 3.1 with a graphics card of a calculator and RAM of a potato! Jokes aside they are most likely blind and are way below the system specs to play this fantastic masterpiece of a game.And so what if Sean Murray lied? Subnautica has higher ratings and that\\'s not even as big as No Man\\'s Sky. And Subnautica has almost the same graphics as NMS so what\\'s your problem?! Sure, multiplayer may or may not be implented because of ONE INCIDENT. But even if Sean Murray lied about that just accept the way NMS is! Not as many Subnautica features were lied about but even if they were, what difference would it make? The same\\'s with NMS. Subnautica doesn\\'t have Multiplayer, and so what? NMS doesn\\'t either! Review No Man\\'s Sky is actually a very fun game to play. Watching it is boring as hell, though. I immediately got hooked into the game as soon as I started playing. Unfortunately this game isn\\'t for everyone. There\\'s little variety in the genre and it really sticks to one thing; Exploration. If you can\\'t stand exploring planets on foot and seeing different terrains, this game isn\\'t for you.Also you can\\'t build in No Man\\'s Sky, just pointing that out.Now here\\'s the good bit. On every planet you go to, all the animals\\' voices are different, they look different, EVERYTHING. IS. DIFFERENT. No joke, even the plants! On every planet! Imagine that, a game with everything completely unique to the last planet you visited. Nifty eh?Now no game is perfect and the same\\'s with this game. Obviously this is indie so I won\\'t be too harsh. Pros • Endless, unique gameplay.• Two different endings: Galactic Core and Atlas Path.• Every single creature is never the same from the last ones you saw on a different planet.• Ship varieties. (I often wait around at space stations waiting for an epic looking one)• Awesome soundtrack that plays throughout your gameplay.• 3 different races you can trade with, all with unique voices.• Massive exploration on either barren, rocky planets to lush planets filled with trees and life. Cons • Eventually gets a tiny bit repetitive.• To save, you must find a shelter. You can\\'t just save anywhere.• Hard to find a good ship with lots of slots• Hard to get better Hyperdrives to travel to better systems (from worst to best, Yellow, Red, Green,      Blue)• Slow start. (except for people who preordered the game, you are fine.)Overall I think the game is great, and if you like exploring planets then the game is for you. Buy it while you can\\nA fun, accessible, bite sized \"RPG\" with a creative concept and a beautiful artstyle. I would say don\\'t play for the gameplay, it\\'s basically a \\'Fisher-Price: Babies first turn based combat system\\'. There\\'s actually more strategy in trying to not win a battle, as the game makes it extremely easy for you. Instead, play the game for it\\'s hilariously written story and enjoyable feel. A great way to blow off some steam.\\nLike a 10 hour long South park episode.-Tho I miss some big characters from the show, like Santa, Satan and Saddam. -It could be longer, considering it costs 40€. +Only game i\\'m buying Dlc\\' for.+Huge replay valueTENOUTTATEN!\\nA really fast paced platformer.

But not perfect as you should expect from a early access.The people behind this game are so on to it that they have a build in Feed back Feature and not only that, you get and achievement for doing so.but yea, over all a 9/10 for absolutely everything within this gameKinda like Minecraft, Space engineers and the long dark staged underwater, But cooler and more awesome\\nIts great when it\\'s free!!!\\nI cannot recommend this game highly enough. 9.5/10, one of the most fun and perfect FPSs I\\'ve ever played. If you love Battlefield, or MAG, or any type of game with large-style conflict, you have to try this game. It\\'s transcontinental combat with three factions vying for dominance on a massive scale. With a realistic day and night cycle and more terrain and areas than you can shake a stick at, whilst also being free-to-play, words can\\'t even begin to do it justice. Just give it a try yourself.\\nA nice Roman-themed little city builder, It\\'s a great choice for anyone who enjoyed games like Caesar III, Pharaoh, or the Tropico games. Similar scale of cities, with good enough graphics to be pretty and good enough depth in the city-building to provide strategic depth. I\\'ve found it to be stable and smooth on a wide range of computers, from low-powered laptops to high-end rigs, so it\\'s also a good game for travelling with.The biggest challenge in the game is the city building rather than the combat, it\\'s more a city simulator than a wargame (again, like Caesar or Pharaoh). \\nJust a Thumbs up\\nTML Studios have published yet another quite detailed simulator. Almost OMSI like levels of interaction with the bus, a lot of features are necessary to the game and gives that extra feel of realism. Those owners of Euro Truck Simulator 2 that would enjoy taking a bus for a spin would love this game. Some small features are missing, such as passengers actually walking onto the bus, but as with all TML games, only functional games are published with very little bugs that aren\\'t game breaking.I tecommend this game to anyone looking for a bus simulator that is both pleasing to the eye and in depth.\\nvery good game\\nSuper bom!!!!!!!\\nOkay, I\\'ll be blunt with you.Want some story?Want Edge of the field Graphics?How about some fantastic AI?Don\\'t get this gameDo you want almost endless progression with hundreds of pieces of gear each for all 4 classes?Do you want great variety between each playstyle?Perhaps the massive number of mission and insane enemy variety?Actually, how about this- Do you want to have fun?Thats it, That is the single greatest feat this game has- its absolutely terrificly fun, it harkons to the error when a game cared for nothing but making sure you left with a smile on your face and a longing to try it again.While i\\'ll mention the fact that this game is best played co-op (With up to 4 players) its still a hilarity on singleplayer, Everything from voice acting that sounds so absolutely wrong- yet is so right, The game is buggy and feels like a PS2 game, But everything bad about this game makes it so much better.Just buy it, Get your mates and buy it- The gameplay draws you in, You stay for the insanity and leave in a banquet of explosions and giant mech punching your friend into a skyscraper.Go on, buy it.\\nSuch an addicting game!Customization is phenominal, the ammount you can do is ridiculous.It does have a little bit of a learning curve, once you get it the satisfaction is very rewarding!Especially with the new engine underway this game is going to get better!\\nI tried playing this game but I died of a foot infection.How did that happen?\\nExtremely Fun To Play And Its Free!!!

Other than that I enjoy customizing the cars for the coasters or the colors of the paths or que lines. I enjoy the fact that the peeps have a mind of their own. Some dont like to ride certain rides, some only like roller coasters.The Coaster Builder. - Took me alot of time to get used to, forgetting to use shift to make it rise, or tilt. I enjoy the fact that some coasters can spin, reminded me of *Thrillville off the rails*.I enjoy the fact that the mascots seem to make everyone happy. I also enjoy that there are SO MANY differnt food buildings, theres like 4 different buildings just for tacos and salads!!!One thing that I really really enjoy is that I can ramp the paths, like, I made a little river, so I boosted the path up to go over the river, and I put a wooden rollercoaster track under and over it, so My peeps can enjoy a good coaster on the entrance of the park. The performance isnt 10/10, nor is the FPS, but it is playable....Im surprised my FPS lasted pretty good with the ammount of items and peeps in the park, there were around 1,800 peeps in the park and over hundreds of differnt pieces. 6 Roller coasters spread out all over. 60+ food buildings, 8 mechanic buildings with 10 mechanics for each building. 5 entertainer buildings, once again 10 entertainers for each building. 9 Janitor buildings, 10 janitors for each building. atleast 80 plants and trees, a lake, and over 10 thrill / family / and Junior rides..... Peeps arent to bad, yeah they walk through each other, but eventually theres so many peeps in your park you dont even notice it. Peeps - 8/10Id rate the game 8/10Path Placement - 7/10\\nRobocraft is a rediculously fun game that allows alot of creativity and freedom due to not so recent updates. When these updates came out, I was allready max level so I automaticly unlocked every component. I think tht it is a good chalenging game that actually invovles alot of dicision making, like what to build how to build it, should I scrap this bot and all that kind of fun shinanagins. Anyway, I think that robocraft is a really good fre2play game that has a lot of really cool features and is just a really cool game in general.\\nEverything you\\'ve heard about this puzzle game is true.

I had it originally on PS3 and picked it up recently on PC with the steam sale including all the DLC and i throughly enjoyed it. the motion captor work gone into the facial expression at that time was amazing and I am yet to find a modernised police/detective game I enjoy as much as i do with L.A Noire. giving the graphics a bit of leeway given the original DX9 that it launched wih i still find the game as enjoyable as when i played through the game in 2011. throughly recommend even in todays standards from a gameplay and story point of view.\\nEpic RPG.Pretty much the best game to come out in 2011.Compared to its own series though it doesnt do well.Skyrim has so many features removed from it it wasnt even funny.It was made with consoles in mind and not PC.Morrowind still holds the highest standards for a RPG game.Not even mods can save this game.\\nI mean, it\\'s O.K. I\\'m not exactly one to write an essay about games. So. If you like this game, don\\'t get it, get a different game. I have it in my library, I think it\\'s called \"Emergency 20XX (It gave me multiple versions\" and there\\'s another one, get these instead. At least in those games. The ambulances RETURN after taking patients to the hospital, this allows you to avoid calling 10000 ambulances when you don\\'t need them. They have all the same units. You may even think they are identical (Part of the reason I got the game), but the other games are pretty much just a more polished version of this game.\\nUnfortunately the game continues to crash on me.\\nMy reveiw for \"Heros & Generals on Ice\" The movement in-game feels like the character is on ice. Even though the game was patched to change it it still feels like my character slides and floats after i jump. Feels too much like a pay to win. 10/10 would slide\\nOne of the worst games i have very played this game is absolute crap!\\nI paid $12 to write this review.\\nA Borderlands 2 Guide:Let\\'s see...Borderlands 2 the gem of ...... games. This game deserves to be removed from gaming forever. The storyline is downright terrible and can cause you to go slightly ......... The voice acting is terrible, animations are glitched beyond imagination and there are so many other things that are bad about this excuse of a game. Overall It\\'s just a terrible game that should be WGOTC - Worst Game Of The Century. FINAL VERDICT:0/10 DISGRACE (This is why there is a 0 in rating. To rate games like this which are terrible)\\ni like the look of the game but i cant play it because it crashes when you try to join a match i suggest playing this game when its updated and actually works so i dont recommend this at the moment\\nVery Bad Disliked it I will Give it About a 3/10\\nhello there, oh your new ok well you can click the play button and join a lobby full of 5 year veterans that don\\'t speak English, cool isn\\'t it? tell all your friends and force them to play this PAY 2 WIN GAME! with the most f*#ked up controls and unfair matchmaking. but there\\'s more join today and get an increased, yep increased price on all real cash items. so join today!\\nOnly thing that is good about this game is the music.\\nTerrible loot system that breeds toxicity. one can play a 1k hours and still not get 2 or 3 trinket esential for high difficulty level, never mind the fact one need to play those levels for such loot. So far after 200+ hours, only 3 headgear, 2 for a character i played 3 times and 1 for my main.  Amongst the plethora of customization the devs made, they block it all with RNG like some cheap F2P devils.Dying population not addresed with maps or mods.New dlc lackluster and wrecks balance for some items.Here\\'s hoping the devs have some sense to see this situation. Here\\'s a thumbs down for the point.\\nCrappy, unfinished game.The sound effects are all beeps and boops.Controller support sucks - unplayable.Valve should change the words \"early access\" to \"unfinished project\".\\nLaggy, bad dialouge, with bad graphics as a bonus.

And yes, the official servers can and should be considered a part of the game, and therefore subject to criticism.Private, whitelisted servers are the way to go, but it\\'s hard to get any serious PvP going on those.\\nHello all, I was so hyped for this game i bought and then the game hit the start of screen and it was completely black and then it just crashed, Now i did a lot of things to fix this issue and found out its not my computer but the game its self, It does not run for some reason on windows 10 computers with all the requirements to run this game, I will put the game on follow and i have already refunded it, Please devs fix this issue its been 6 months or so since the issue was found, Please hurry it up and fix this issue, New Gen computer systems like Windows 10 should run this but for some reason your game is not opitizmed for it, Heck my computer can run Homebrew - Vehicle, On high graphics but not even start up this game, I was really looking forward to playing this game.

I completed it without tutorials in less than three hours, and I lack the common sense to solve most puzzles without heavy pondering.Here\\'s an actual review for you:In this game, you are A.R.I.D., an AI helping an unconcious piot to safety by controlling his mechanical suit. All this game really boils down to is a point-and-click adventure game with some short combat sequences, from a side-scrolling perspective. The atmosphere is well-made, but I feel a majority of the puzzles are a bit too open-ended (for one, you have to jump underneath a ten-foot-wide elevator where the only control panel for it is on the elevator itself).Again, it\\'s not worth it in its current state. I may change my review when more content is added.There is a Twilight Zone-caliber ending, though.\\nWARNING GAVE ME A VIRUS!!!!!!!\\ni like cs source better\\njust amazed why this game still alive LOL !!!\\neven before the whole \"Zoe Quinn\" saga i still thought this game was ....\\nhow do i refund this ;-;\\nGraphics: 8/10 Great graphics.

It makes it feel like in order to enjoy a game the devs are forcing me to pay real money, a few people say its possible to get everything it just takes a while, it\\'s kind of like saying play all day everyday just so you can actually play the game. this isn\\'t right and feels like the devs are trying to exploit players by giving paying members way more then a free player can imagine.\\n10/10 IA shooting\\nFull of drm always online cba cracking this.Not worth buying in a nutshell.\\nThis game crashes at start can\\'t even play it.\\nWaiting simulator 2015\\nAt first glance it seemed like a pretty interestomg title making me easily think that the nostalgia would come back to me but that was short lived.

The game is fun at the start and you get to know the basics. But after finishing the turtorial and a few other levels of beating other player\\'s castles it starts to get repeative. Litterally all there is to it is fighting th same castle over and over and over. All because it takes forever to level up your character and castle. I wish I could recommend this game, but there just need to be a bit more varaity in castle making. Another thing is that the game takes way too long to play, you could play this game for a full straight 24 hours and to Ubisoft, its absolutly no progress... I thought this was a good game, until I noticed all these problems. So unless you want to waste about a week of your life, DO NOT PLAY!!!\\nGarbage. AI wins all the time. I get the lead, finish 4th.

They even silence reviews, as i heard, ban people for playing music on Brian Hicks\\' stream and then deny it while blocking the banned person\\'s posts on forums and even Reddit with all the evidence that he needed to prove himself.The devs should\\'ve kept progress with the mod, not start afresh with a full game that has been in alpha for 2 years.You guys promised us so much yet you keep working on entirely different aspects, then put a big lable \"Early Access\" as an excuse for slow development\\nDEVS PLEASE!I DON\\'T NEED WINGS!

There\\'s very little variety, and it takes ages to finish a run.Maybe you can coast through it on nostalgia alone, but you\\'d have to REALLY love the original to justify even the 5 dollar price tag.\\nThe game is remniscent of the Dungeon Keeper series and provides a slightly nostalgic feel. The graphical style and detailed overworld are quirky and creative but are ultimately overshadowed by the slow placed and repeitive gameplay. A major downfall is in its lack of flexible micromanagment and preset room layots. Players are also prevenetd from changing preset room layouts at the start of each new map which limits creativity and needlesy increases difficult as the treasure hold is always placed close to the entrance (where enemeies enter to plunder your dungeons treasure). Imire does provided a wide range of unique creatures and a interesting team combo feature, rewarding creative team combinations. The storyline also contains interesting aspects. Overall the agme is satisfactory if you want a casual play but is no Dungeon Keeper 3.\\nI like the game but this game has quite a bit of bugs. After playing the for a while I came across a game breaking glitch that froze everything.Until bug fixes come out I say save your money and wait.\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, This game is fun as hell. But if you are new to the game don\\'t even bother playing, You are just going to get wrecked by older players it\\'s impossible to do anything without getting yelled at by other players.

I LOVED IT-----------------READ-------------------This game has now turned into nothing the dev team left and updates are every 6 months not even. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!\\nThis game is completely unplayable for me.The game always freezes at certain points, forcing me to manually turn my computer off and on from its power button.I have tried disabling its auto save feature, uninstalling and reinstalling the game, deleting the game’s files from my PC, etc. but nothing seems to help.Therefore I cannot recommend this game until this issue gets fixed (which it probably won’t).  \\nPOOOPEST GAME EVER\\nNope, i had my space ship all sorted and then an update was released that took all of my staffs away stupid\\nThis is a flawless game...except for one solid point.Too many hackers.I played this, like, over 2 years ago, and was one of the best players. Now, it seems more and more people are becoming hackers in PvP games, not just this one. Almost every online FPS on Kongregate has a 1:5 player to hacker ratio now, and this game is already there. Guys, introduce VAC, because i literally cannot play.Did i say flawless?Sorry, i meant it\\'s a PILE OF ....ING ..... THIS GAME USED TO BE AMAZING. But ever since like, what, a year or 2 ago, it\\'s been down right TERRIBLE. I would not recommend this to ANYONE. 2 years ago, maybe, but now, NO.FIX YOUR GAME.\\nHad tons of fun before i switched over to windows 10. Alot of people are also having problems playing on windows 10, so if you are on windows 10 be careful because it might not work.----- I actually had alot of fun on battle royal, so did alot of people and why h1z1 was popular and the devs took that in account and decide to do the thing that would make the players angry.Seprate the battle royal mode and the surival mode and charge $24 for each game. Yes you heard me, 24 dollars for each bloody game. Even though if u originally owned the game you wouldnt need to buy battle royal again that means for new players it\\'s really daunting. If you havn\\'t checked out \" The culling \" it is a better version and a better vision for what a battle royal game should be. --- DO NOT BUY --\\nWhen ever I load a new world with mods it crashes on the loading screen! PLEASE FIX IT!!!!!!!!\\nWTF this game is .... #CallOfDutyForLyfe\\nI love Postal and all, but postal 3 was totally trashed, the game is a nutshell of crashes and bugs, i wish i could play this to the end, but even that is impossible due to the fact this game crashes every 5 min from every little thing that pops out.If you look to play Postal, just buy POSTAL 2.\\nLaggy af and crashes often. Bad news.\\nCURRENT REVIEW - NEGATIVEmy new review is based on trade feature behind a paywall. crafting class like alchemist and pardoner are useless because even with token, you can only trade for 30 times a month or simply you are paying $0.6 to make 1 trade.unless they change the trading features, im gonna put this on negative review.Tree of Savior became MMORPG Simulator. a Single Player MMORPG that simulates cash grab or paywalls and selfish players like kill stealing and trash talking players.PREVIOUS REVIEW - POSITIVEplayed this, got auto attack delays (1 sec stuck on AA animation) but skills are ok not much delaylove the soundtracks, artworks and the gameplay itself although i keep on making new characters during the beta (finding a good build) i never got bored unless i really f*k up and messed with my characterTL;DR? - the best if you have low ping. good with 200-300ms. not good for 301-450ms. the worst for 451ms+To people putting a negative review based on the release date showing march 19 2016please do note that it is publicly released on steam this day so that people can pre-load it. other people can download it in a matter of minutes while others may take several hours (like i do 1gb = 1hr wait). be glad that we get to have an early access on march 29 and official release (f2p) after a month than the previous one which is june 2016 which is longer.\\nI\\'m a big fan of the Deus Ex series. Human Revolution was a really worthy return to the Cyberpunk series. However I can\\'t recommend this release at all. It\\'s nothing more than an outsourced poorly realized package. Design choices in terms of the lighting were completely thrown out as just one example, another is just how incredibly buggy it is.The lighting that I refer to was a \"gold\" tint of perhaps Jensen\\'s augmentations in first person and even indicative perhaps of a \"new renaissance\" thematically. This was in promotional footage, cases etc. There are other visual differences but this is the biggest. They completely ignored the original teams aesthetics and choices.\\nbad gameshld b f2p\\nJust no.Trust me dis game sucks!\\nPay2Win, Overkill greed company dont buy this game !\\nthis game sucks\\nwould be yes if this game didnt cost more than whats expected..should be renamed from \\'tea party simulator\\' to \\'extra chromesome simulator\\'its way too hard to play.\\nHoly .... the beggining to this game is the most boring thing I have done voluntarily in my life\\nPoor oversight by Magic 2015 developers in the game.Positives include a catchy theme song, ability to construct a deck to however you like, storyline is not a bad inclusion, opening more boosters to provide anticipation and excitement.Sadly however the negatives definately out weigh the positives.You are restricted in deck building to a limited selection of cards after you have completed the campaign unless you which ti invest in \"boosters\" to increase your card pool. Matching up against others who have superior cards or/even duplicates or sets of 4 card(s) whom have purchased additional boosters, not only makes deck building difficult, ineffective but also increases the likelihood that you will be demorilised over and over again in matches against other opponents in 1 v 1 or free for all matching.I generally enjoy purchasing this product for the puzzle games, Last turn puzzles a few years ago were amazing and difficult/challanging. 2014 however showcases some very sub par puzzles games and this year, well, there are none.I played one game of free for all on 4 v 4 and I felt so far away from the game table I requested my flatmate to provide me a magnifine glass. myself and another player also realised 4 turns in that we had already lost when one of the players threw down some superior cards for which we had not even access to.This put me off continuing playing this game into the future as really there is no point unless I am wishing to invest into this.Suggestions would be to at least bring \"two headed giant\" match making back, a level par card selection by perhaps charging a set $15 fee from the start and not this \"micro transaction booster option\" which is poor oversight in my opinion and perhaps even a tournament mode where equal par magic the gatherers could paticipate tournaments of 10 players etc, round robin to then provide a level based system and a decent points rating for those wishing to climb to the top in rankings over time (by winning more tourney\\'s etc)Rating, interface, music score, Story concept 6/10 (as what else can you do with a story really)gameplay campaign 5/10 (as well the AI seems to get the perfect run of cards sometimes :S)Deck building feature, 8/10 as this is very flexibleCard selection 2/10 (extremely limited unless additional investments made)gameplay vs human 3/10 (for the reason you will become frustate that you are unable to build a deck that is consistent without investment into more booster packs)Overall I would probably rate Magic 2015 4/10\\nThis game is really bad, i think that anyone that see\\'s the trailer thinks it is good, that y i got it. But it is decieving and is really bad to play! DO NOT GET IT!\\nI was an early adopter, having loved SupCom and seeing the potential of this game. However, it does not load on SteamOS! The game black screens on load up with the music looping in the background. Like a mug i paid $60 for this game. Very disappointed. Hope they fix access issues!!!\\nHack, Slash, Loot, or \"HSL\", looks charming at first with it\\'s retro-style pixel art... until you realize that the gameplay is even more primitive. It is not an understatement to say that everything in this game either comes down to little more than random chance and comparing numbers. Combat is completely limited to clicking on an enemy until they die. That\\'s it. No special moves, no abilities, no changing gear, nothing. Sure, depending on your weapon you either use melee, ranged or magic attacks, but unless you\\'re fighting near a weapon drop you can\\'t change on the fly, plus your character will usually specialize in one type so there\\' very little reason to change unless you get VERY skewed consumable drops (more on that later). At best you can try to bottleneck enemies in doorways or tight coriidors to fight them one by one, or run away and hope you find something useful before you get surrounded, but that barely qualifies as \"strategy\". And even then, you still have to hope that RNGesus is smiling down upon you. The item system is almost as primitive. Most of the time, it feels less like you are trying to decide which weapon or piece of armor to equip, and more like you\\'re just comparing numbers (although special damage types such as the stunning Lighting do make things a little more interesting) As for consumables, you never know if a potion or w/e will help and/or hinder you, meaning once again it\\'s entirely up to luck rather than any sort of choice or strategy if it help you.Oh, and there\\'s no save system. At all.All in all, this game had a lot of potential, but instead the gameplay is comparable to banging your head against a wall while comparing helmets and popping pills that \"might\" make it hurt less. What this game needed was something, ANYTHING that might have made the gameplay more complex than dice rolling: Abilities/items to use in a pinch, swapping around weapons, etc etc: anything that would make success less dependant on how lucky you are. If you\\'re at all thinking of picking up this title anyway, I highly recommend buying another game called One-Way Heroics instead, which in a nutshell is practically like this game with the improvements I just suggested, and at only somewhat more than half the price.\\nI personally do not recommend this game, i do have many friends but none have this game, therefore it is quite boring and the graphics are not great.\\nApparently I couldn\\'t carry a sniper as it was too heavy for me... I was then held up by a squeaker who was eaten by zombies which i tried to turn around and shoot but game bugged out once again and magazines left my invent as attempting to hold a sniper wipes your invent.Dayz is double the price but 50x better than this piece of .... and Dayz itself is only in pre alpha... Do yourself a favour and keep the money in your pocket and spend it on worthy games.So i say proudly, if you own this game uninstall it, if you want to buy this game or are even remotley considering it, look up dayz/rust right now.\\nTHIS GAME IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ....

Poor effort Ubisoft  poor effort.\\nGone home is a drama storytelling walking simulator game.Most of these types of games are usually a hit or miss,for me this one was a miss.The plot usually leads you with much expectation ,giving the good soundtrack and the design of the enviroments,but ends with a \"meh\" kind of situation.Giving that,the side stories end being more interesting than the main story itself,if you explore a lot.Sadly after its over,there is nothing more to look for.These kind of walking simulators games (with rare exceptions) are made more to be appreciated than be played.\\nIt looks great.It isn\\'t great at all. ......

I don\\'t care what excuse the company has, not even if they\\'re a charity. 10 dollars for the occasional  \"oh yeah that\\'s different\" is BULLcrap.  How can the physics be so off for a source engine game? What excuse does this game have when monsters you just kill start floating off into the horizon???

No refund for me, im stuck with this peice of ....- previous review(Lots of reviews out their are saying things like \"repetitive\" and they\\'re right, it is repetitive, but that is what you get from an exploration survival game, if you dont like Minecraft... Then chances are you wont like this game, but if you liked Minecraft before you turned 12 and the world started shaming you for playing it, then yes this game is for you.2 things when buying a game, 1 read the tags, 2, Read the reviews, if the reviews say its repetitive, and the tags say exploration, then its a ... exploration game.Personally I enjoy playing this game, thats why i spent the entire saturday when the day it came out playing it, its got a nice storyline and goes for everything i love, deep space exploration, Sci-fi, Survival, those are all things that i love but i never saw in the form of a 3D game.)\\ni loved this game ever since punkbuster now im not able to join any multiplayer games so i whant a refund\\nI wish Mocap Studio wasn\\'t so much, basic enthusiasts can\\'t do .... because of the price.\\nWaste of time. Brought it I cant even log in through steam or through an account\\nA bland and boring \"game\" made by an ....... called Phil Fish (Look him up)It looks good, but good graphics isn\\'t a substitute for bad gameplay.The puzzles and worlds are overly simple to solve/navigate and the only mechanic gets boring to use after an hour.Don\\'t trust all the big review sites like IGN and don\\'t spend money on this boring \"experience\", buy a dvd on paint drying in slow motion(More interesting than FEZ will ever be) it\\'s not worth buying this game for the full price or discounted in steam sales.\\nthis game become pay 2 win\\nA Massive disappointment, i managed to play this in my old computer and nearly got till the endnow in my better faster computer, it does nothing but crash and/or freeze\\nThe xbox version is a ton better than thisFor one it tends  to close off on me.. and even when it did load it didnt register acheivements. I would definintely reccomend the xbox version over this because its ten times easier to use voice chat too. It also sucks in a sense of bad facebook and twitter opens\\nI played this game for 17 minutes and crashed 5 times. Then I requested a refund. It is a long bow to draw to call this a \\'game\\'. Would not buy in its current state albeit the concept seems reasonable.\\nMy favourite game for 4 years got an \\'update\\'.Guess I\\'ll go try overwatch now.\\nBought the game to see what the hype is about (despite it being five years old.)If you\\'ve played any game in the last three years (Minecraft and Goat Simulator included) I guarantee you they have better mechanics than this.Although this game may have been cutting edge five years ago, any game on the market today will top it gameplay wise.Also, they grappling hook isn\\'t great.Yeah, I went there.\\nSeriously, don\\'t waste your money on this game - Go and source yourself a copy of the latest in the Airport Tycoon series, or Airline Tycoon Evolution. These games will give you much your enjoyment and keep you entertained for much much longer than this game will.For the purpose of the review, I stuck at this game for 18 hours according to Steam before finishing it. Honestly, after the first hour, it was a sad reaity that all one would do the for majority of the time was sit and stare at a screen and click a few buttons every few minutes.This game should be rated \"P\" for PATHETIC. It feels drastically un-finished, the game physics are poor (and have been demonstrated by numerous others who have played this game). I\\'m sure whatever money that the Developers have made from this game, they wouldn\\'t be able to take into a Brothel and organise a root.

I waited Five years to buy skyrim once it dipped to a price I could afford so I could explore the wonderful world of modding and now it costs money. absolutely disgraceful.\\nIt was good until the the DLC but the reast is great\\nPlenty of potential but still a long way to go. Very limited optionsGame is local multi-player only - there\\'s almost nothing else to do besides this as far as I can tell - no AI vs and no network play as far as I could tellControllers are a mustPerformance even on a relatively high end PC (i7 4770/GTX 680/16GB RAM/SSD) can be quite poor at times an anything but \"fastest\" graphics settings In its current state it\\'s difficult to recommend.\\nThis game is ver well made, very pretty, and great in theory, but I found myself getting bored and frustrated with it quickly. The main purpose of this online game is to gather provisions, build a base, and defend said base against raids, or you can raid other bases. I have two major problems with it though. 1) the game\\'s servers frequently reset, which can be every week, or more. This results in the base you spent so much time building, which may be days, to be erased. 2) as I mentioned, you can raid bases or be raided by other players. However, you are left vulnerable whilst you are offline. So people can raid your base while you\\'re not there to defend it. This is really awful as it takes an incredibly long time to research and produce certain items.Some players may find this thrilling or challenging, but I find it frustrating and pushes me away from spending time in the game. Try it if you do so desire, but I do not recommend it.\\nThis game sounded really good so i downloaded it, it didn\\'t take that long so i thought cool but when i got to the gameplay it is slow boring and they don\\'t teach you anything you have to figure it out on your own and the gameplpay is SO SLOW you can be walking/jogging because the running doesn\\'t really count as running but back to the point you can be going around for hours and not find ANY animals and you have to pay to be able to hunt more than 2 different species of animals it is such a waste of time REALLY dissapointing ik i haven\\'t put much time into the game but so far it is bad.\\nStuck in some kind of server limb. Everythign is black, i can see my ship and some other ships in the blackness. I can shoot my cannons and stuff but my whole HUD is gone and im stuck. I\\'ve been like this, logigng on and off of the game, steam and restarting my computer but im still stuck in this limbo. I can\\'t jon a new game because it keeps saying i have to rejoin this perpetual game thats beign going on for hours.\\nthis a waste of money and gameplay is so bad nothing is fair DO NOT BUY THIS!\\nExcellent game made by skilled artists and 3D modellors. The team that manages the engine and physics are quite good, though not the best. Aircraft and vehicle modelleling is the greatest I\\'ve seen for a game with such a variety of vehicles. Gameplay is amazingly smooth and simple.I cannot recommend it due to many controversial decisions made by the developers. Ignoring the playerbase in terms of balancing the matchmaking. Gaijin have created a problem that only becomes worse. When there are many players playing a large range of vehicles, (generally) effective matchmaking would clump a few evenly matched vehicles together for an intense fight.However if a vehicle was introduced/\"balanced\" to be too effective/ineffective, naturally people would flock/avoid that vehicle. This creates increased queue times due to the inbalance of demand of vehicles. People complain and Gaijin allows a wider variety int he one game, this can (and did) lead to further imbalance. Thus, more people avoid it/leave. This makes the balancing act harder and both Gaijin and the playerbase stressed.Of course, this depends on your reason on playing War Thunder and the matchmaking may not be a concern, also Gaijin isn\\'t doing too badly at the moment, it\\'s just greatly inconsistent matchmaking leading to either utter defeat or victory simply due to vehicle selection and not player skill.Any aircraft could easily kill a much higher tiered aircraft if they\\'re not using their speed advantage or experience. I have killed MiG-15\\'s in an F6F Hellcat. However in ground forces, it is practically impossible to kill a much higher tiered tank due to their armor and firepower keeping you at a massive disadvantage.Game Modes:Arcade Battles:Best place to learn the ropes, manoeuvres target leading, positioning, awareness and map knowledge. Physics have been tweaked for faster gameplay and easier to handle aircraft. This mode is where I spent about half of my time on, learning how to fly different types of aircraft and their weapons. Ground forces arcade is very intense and can be very much run, gun, die repeat. Dodging cannons rounds and ramming enemies off cliffs.Realistic Battles:Common for more skilled players like myself. Vehicles perform closely to historical documents (which aren\\'t the most accurate due to multiple sources). Requires extensive knowledge of own vehicle, enemies and map to effectively defeat the enemy. In this game mode, teamwork and communication is also introduced. (Yes, teamwork and communication is almost non-existent in arcade) NOTE: Although teamwork is indeed key, people are people and will sometimes be selfish or ignorant which can lead to many losses. You basically have to hope that your team isn\\'t braindead to charge the enemy into a disadvantaged position.Simulator Battles:What is this? DEAD :(In aircraft used to force cockpit views and requires a joystick (although with practice you can go without). It tries to have the primary components of real combat without having to worry about issues real pilots have. Can be very intense however it has an extreme learning curve and almost certainly requires a wingman. Like RB, however these skills are truly put it to the test.The game indeed has its great moments, when the odds are stacked even greater against you than the developers intended and you still break through. However too often you\\'ll just die hopeless, with the only way of avoiding it is to drag out the match.\\nits a good game but alot of bugs and even when i put everything on LOW still lags... i suggest anyone thinking of buying this game to hold back until a few issues are fixed\\npile of garbage, DON\\'T BUY.\\nIt\\'s a great game, and the ships really handle as I had expected them to.Only one problem.No Australian servers.It would be nice if we existed to other countries. One or two servers would be fine and awesome, but having none just makes me sad. I don\\'t understand how US, EU and Asia all have 4 - 5 servers each, but there are no Aussie servers.Which means lag, lag and more lag for us Kangaroos.So while in any other circumstance I would be most wholeheartedly recommending this game, the lack of Australian servers disallows me to see a reason to.I mean, seriously! You\\'re disadvantaging like 10 people! That\\'s 10 people too many! :(\\nWell, this game has been something for me...I played this game pretty often and is considered one of the games I really enjoyed playing for a long amount of timeThe gameplay is simple, Play, grind, play with friends, grind, get better gear, go to auction and grind for more. It may sound really boring, but the gameplay experience with friends is enough to satisfy your whole day.Why give this a NO for a reccomendation? It\\'s because the game\\'s dead. Very few updates, very few online players also since the head developer left and SEGA not really supporting this game to its full potential, the game became too repetitive with no new contents now and then.It\\'s still shiny, it looks good but the game experience is all gone. Definitely if you want to try it out go ahead, but it\\'ll be a rough time for you to enjoy the game longer since not many people are active in the game\\nGame is WarZ. Do not make the same mistake I did. I thought this would be a great alternative to DayZ as my computer couldn\\'t run it, but seemed like it could run this. This game is full of hackers and only has servers in US and Europe.\\nTL; DR version: for $9.99, this dlc is short and does not add any real content to the game that you can not go without.Now for the long version. I got this dlc as a part of my season pass, so I didn\\'t pay the $9.99 price tag. But if you didn\\'t buy a season pass and are considering buying this dlc separately, I recommend you do not.There are really only two new characters with a decent amount of interaction introduced in this dlc. One I felt was developed very well, and will keep as a companion for a while. The other, was very shallow. There was barely any character development to make me feel anything for them. They could have been a no name raider and plucked at the same heartstrings during the big choice of this dlc.The robot customisation added by this dlc is quite neat. All of it balances nicely with no obvious power play options. And it\\'s fun to have your own custom companion. But this, ultimately, is no different to any other companion. Sure, I can give them sword arms, but I could just give another companion a sword for the same effect. The interface is also slightly confusing; it is difficult to follow what change in damage/resistance a mod will cause without doing the manual check yourself. I was beginning to trust those little +++.Coming into this dlc with a lv 50 character (playing on survival) I really only felt challenged on combat at one stage in this dlc. That\\'s not isolated to this dlc though, I feel fallout 4 has difficulty issues regardless. But this dlc does nothing to rectify this.Oh and if you\\'re not a junk hoarder then I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors amassing your new hoard if you want to build any decent robot mods.There are a few new weapons added in this dlc as well, with the majority being mele, then energy. These are not something a level 50+ is going to start using though. Even with full modification, they fail to pack any considerate punch.There are also some unique power armor mods added in this dlc, but they are non transferable and will only benefit energy weapons users.In the end this dlc adds some cool features to your settlement and a cool new companion, but other than that there is nothing really new that is worth the $9.99 pricetag if you\\'re considering buying this dlc outright.\\ni can\\'t even join lobbys. I have been trying for ages but it doesn\\'t work.\\nThe game started off as awesome. I can remember the times when you progress into new teirs and levels, unlocking different armours, weapons, and utilities. This was great fun up to this point - until alll of a sudden - the updates happened. The diversity of different tiers and levels, dissapeared - the uniqueness of designs, gone - The all-round game play, terrible.What made this game so bad in the end, was the fact that they decided to take all the hard work, grinding, and time off all the users, and just deleted it. Sent everyone back to an abysmal tech tree which made a level 100 and a level 1 the same sturdiness (armour wise). And the devs didnt even refund those who lost their hard earned robots.The development team needs to recognise that what they are/have done has turned a great oppurtunity into a train wreck. This CAN CLEARLY BE SEEN IN REVIEWS. Unless drastic restorations to the game are conducted. YOU WILL NOT ENJOY THIS GAME.\\nIt\\'s like CSGO and Call of Duty had a miscarriage.\\nCRAP!!!!   this game is not fun i paid $1.00 on it and i want it back\\nThe game starts out fun and then just becomes a timesink.  Once the world gets to a certain age its all about the \"Pay To Win\" and if you want to not die, then you better be playing (and buying) 10+ cards a day.Would totaly recomend you bash your head on your desk for just as much enjoyment.\\nnewgrounds\\nNew patch nuff said\\nGame is ... awesome  but made me fail my exam\\nIf I could give this game 0/10 stars I would, hell if I could rate this game as the worst game ever created I would. First of all, let me start off by saying that Black Ops 3 is a Triple A title meaning that it has a huge corporate funding behind it. Obviously we\\'d think that the game would at least be half decent with such a large budget and skilled staff behind its creation. So in conclusion, this game is probably one of the worst Triple A title games you will ever purchase and whether the Triple A title is worth $15 or $100 (like this one) this game is definitely not worth it in anyway. The PC optimisation is absolutely terrible with a bombshell of issues from frame lag to being unable to play the game until you have at least spent a solid night or two getting destroyed by fellow players.\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, its an amazing game and i love it when you can actually walk around when there are no hackers.I have only 17 hours on the game and my friend and i have been raided over 10 times by hackers. now i know people will say \"oh but you are still new to the game they werent hacking\". well thats where you\\'re wrong. Reign Of Kings doesnt have an option where you can sprint across the entire map in a few seconds and teleport through stone walls, therefore allowing the person to take all of your hard earned items. I am actually infuriated by the hackers. They take all of the fun outof the game and crush your experiance of the game. If the game could look at the reports you put on players. I payed $19.99USD for this game, and i use AUD so i payed an extra $6.65 to be greeted by hackers.\\nDISCLAIMER: Ths review is based off very little actual gameplay, but...I have played this game very little, but I am very disappointed.At first Avadon 2 looks like a good throwback to old school RPGs, and it very well might be, however the very first sentence of text in the game was so badly written I barely wanted to continue, but I thought \"Hey, maybe it gets better\", but it didnt...First sentence:\"You walk out of your wrecked, garbage-strewn barracks into another, slightly larger, wrecked, garbage-strewn barracks... once you walk outside, ou can find the scout\"First part of the game and already running out of words to describe things, not good considering this is meant to be an RPG with a great story.\"Its cold outside, but Silke was nice enough to leave your cloak at the door\"Okay, well why didnt tey hang it up somewhere instead of leaving iton the floor?\"You enter the low hall where the woodsmen who lived and worked here took their meals...\"Took their meals? couldnt think of a better word like \"ate\"?\"You hear scratches, you hope they dont smell you\"I hope what doesnt smell me?

Sure, it was decent for the first 2 hours, but as soon as the refund period experied, which was probably the plan of the developers, it got increasingly boring. I want my money back for this scam.\\nbad\\nThe game has a lot of problems, and I am going to list a few of them. Character facing the wrong side. ( This is probably a bug ) No tutorial. Difficulties playing with keyboard. ( Some of the movements that you may want to learn ( located in WAZA ),   requires a controller to execute but fret not, there is a way to learn all the movements ) If you double tap your d key, it will dash forward. However, tapping excessively may cause it to continuously dash. Occasionally, whenever I am in the menu ( in game menu, not the title screen menu ), my game may go into spasm mode, denying me from saving the game to selecting what I am going to train next.Is there a saving grace for this game? Yes there is, make such amendments to the file, kmslot1 ( not going to go into full detail since there is guide for this ), and max out your stats.

I will fight for my refund.\\nThis game needs a lot of work, it crashes so much and it needs to be fixed.\\nNot a very good game at all, with literally hours of unwanted complexity. You may like it, but I thought it was  waste of time and money\\nSad sad Ubisoft. Don\\'t get me wrong, this is a beautiful, extensive, and immersive game. It is an above ground and underwater city builder with complex city management and trade.  HOWEVER, UPlay is a horrendous gaming network and a DRM of 3 installs is appalling (to say it kindly). When I discovered I could only install this on 3 machines I was quite disappointed. Ubisoft support also seems seriously lacking. My son recently made purchase of a hardcopy ubisoft title, registered it to his account but could not download it - was just stuck in a registration loop. He was outright ignored by Ubisoft/Uplay official support contact - even after posting for help on their Facebook page. Eventually he exchanged the game for something worth twice as much (and not needing Uplay). So he posted again to their facebook to let them know he didnt want their assistance anymore because they are useless and he had solved his problem. Within minutes they deleted his post from the page making us well aware that Uplay had seen his original help request but they had deliberately ignored it.I\\'d hate to see what will happen when I have to contact them for a new key for Anno when I next upgrade my machine. If the same DRM restrictions exist for the new Anno when it is released I simply wont be buying it ... ever. In fact my experience with the few Uplay games I do own has taught me to be extremely wary of investing in any Ubisoft games again.\\n-Easy to play-Friendly community-Leveling system is fair and not difficult to do-Customisation for days-Multiple characters to choose from-Hours of gameplay available-Emersive world that will bring you fun and joy-Not COD 2/10 would not waste time playing this game\\nLet me start by saying I don\\'t like bashing game developer:Even when their work only shows about a years work of hard effortThis game could have been something that game developers could of made money of if they truely had time for the people who purchased it.I loved this game but time goes by and you see the cracks I mean I like flying zombies as much as the next guys but this is too far.The game developer could of put so much more time into fixing the bugs and making optimisation than adding a new mapplease lets hope their remake isn\\'t so money hungry or bug infestedPlease don\\'t spend money on this game it isn\\'t worth itGame developers I hope for the next time we meet and you take my money it better be for a good game.\\nPOSITIVESGreat Game! Really fun and there is a lot to do in the game that makes you want to continue to play. There are unlockables like Perks, Offerings, Clothes, Items, Addons etc. You can level up your characters as well as your rank for both Survivor and Killer.You can also play private matches with your friends and you won\\'t lose anything if you do die as a survivor.The ranking system in my opinion is good enough for now; you collect these crystals (at least they look like crystals) called PIPS, according to the official Dead By Daylight Manual, and when you collect a certain amount in a row,  you get promoted. The lowest rank in the game is 20 and the highest rank is 1. To get from rank 20-19 you must collect 3 pips. From Rank 12 and onwards, you must collect 5 pips each rank down, meaning Rank 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 require 5 pips each before you get to Rank 1 for both Survivor and Killer.So the game seems cool, right? Well, most games aren\\'t that perfect...TLDR: Great Game, Fun, Lost of Unlockables, makes you want to continue playing, Private Matches, Ranking System, Collect Pips to Rank Up, Rank 20 lowest rank, Rank 1 Highest Rank.NEGATIVESThe only way to rank up in the game is to play public matches, and this makes it difficult because people try and find their friends so they search and quit lobbies until they find them because you currently CANNOT invite your friends to public matches, only private matches, and some players just boost each other. For example one person plays as the killer, hosting the lobby and the other playing as a survivor, and they troll you. There are many disadvantages in the game too, such as:- The host of every game is the killer. This is bad because almost every killer in the game has a .... ISP.- Everybody is searching for their friends, and sometimes it can take a while to find a game. The longest it took me to once find a game was 1 hour for this reason...- You will lag in almost EVERY game.- You WILL rage.- You WILL die in stupid ways.- You WILL get stuck in objects.- There are HACKERS in this game too!Now it\\'s time to elaborate on these points. The killer being the host of every game really annoys me, just because it gives them a huge advantage. Think of it like this; The host controls everything, and you and your friends are normal people doing normal stuff. But the host has .... internet, and because he controls everything, it affects you and your friends WAY more than it does for him. As a matter of fact, it doesn\\'t affect him at all. LAG will ruin you, and make you rage. I\\'ve lost many games just because of lag. But how does the lag affect you in game? Well, when you attempt to vault over something, like a wall or object, and you\\'re lagging, you are going to die, especially if the killer\\'s chasing you, because what happens is that rather than vaulting, your character FREEZES. Lag also makes you teleport literally everywhere and will get you killed. This is why you will rage and die in the most stupidest ways.You will also get stuck in objects. One time I spawned into a game (The developers call these TRIALS) and I was repairing a generator. Then the killer was coming towards me and I was thinking, \"Oh no problem, I will just hide behind this tree.\" So I go behind \\'This tree\\' and crouch and he walks past me. \"Yeh I\\'m all good.\" I think to myself. Then I go to walk away from the tree and then just like that, I was stuck. I literally couldn\\'t move, and the murderer was coming back. He walked past me again and didn\\'t see me. Although he didn\\'t see me, I was still very angry, because I wasn\\'t going to be able to survive unless I get him to kill me. So I just quit and also got demoted and lost my item. This is why the Killer has such a HUGE advantage in the game. This also isn\\'t the only object I\\'ve gotten stuck into.I have recorded games I\\'ve played where my connection with the Killer was very bad, and I will perhaps upload them soon to my Steam profile/YouTube channel (Link on Profile!). So be sure to check those out if you would like to see more on what I\\'m talking about.Last but not least, hackers, yes, there are hackers already... And the game was only recently released, EVEN with an ANTI-CHEAT! This just really confuses me as to why their anti-cheat software hasn\\'t even banned these players yet. I saw a player who had prestiged his Claudette Morel to level 1000, which at this stage, is an impossible stage to even be on. Most players, almost all, haven\\'t even prestiged, including myself. TLDR: Game has more negatives than positives. ConclusionSo to conclude my review, this game needs more development. The game is great and fun, but when you take the negatives into account, Dead By Daylight isn\\'t really the best game to buy at this time. I believe the developers didn\\'t give enough time on their project and should have continued developing the game and released it at a later date. But the developers are still working on patches and have apparently said they wil be allowing people to invite their friends to public games instead of just private games. So to say they should be adding more patches as well. But in the meantime, I recommend you should save your money for the time being and wait till more patches come through.Thank you for reading my review!\\n10/10 gr8 uninstallGo find the old version online.\\nMEDIOCRE!\\nPossibly the biggest waste of money ever created, developer\\'s give 0 care to customer\\'s and practically gives you the finger if you buy this game.

Which leads to a dull repetitve game with the same thing over and over again.If you own the vanilla dark souls 2, dont buy this, its a downgrade.keep away from this stinker, nothing to see here.\\nUpdate: Some features were fixed, however I would still wait for full release.Way too expensive, for how glitchy it is...I would recomment buying it when its out of alpha.The Co-op mode does not allow you to save, so once you leave all of your hard work is gone.Ladders and ropes that you climb are  also involved in a lot of delicate ....ery if you want to use them without killing yourself. The game needs more polish, and I would not buy it untill either the beta or its full release.Update: Some features were fixed, however I would still wait for full release.I tried to play coop on 20/03/2016, as of that date your are STILL unable to load save files, as such if you want to play with a friend you need to start from scratch every time.\\ni cant get past the tutorial part where u do the youtube video. it is the second half where the wall opens and when i middle click the guy gos no\\nToo many zombiesreminds me of my childhood......ic texturesLike... seriouslyi came with the force of a thousand homeless men10/10heil der fuhrer\\nIf you read my other review for Toy Soldiers: Complete, then sadly this review is going to be the complete opposite. Toy Soldiers: War Chest is simple not worth the money that it asks for £11.99 (for the standard game) and £24.99 (for the hall of fame addition). Although it includes characters from different franchises you have to pay £3.99 for the privilage of owning that character - such as GI Joe and Cobra which is a real kick in the teeth! But the game forces you to do this as the basic armies are crap! The only playable basic army is the WW1 German Army, the rest are boring, stupid and a waste of time. On top this the game is meant for a console, you can\\'t control aircraft because they do a million flips if you sneeze or move around (plus they are so weak!), the gameplay is repetative and boring, additionally none of your friends have the game or players who have the game don\\'t do multiplayer.To Conclude:if you are looking for the following items in this gameNo or limited funBad/Mediocre reviews (check out gamespot or ign if you don\\'t believe me)Expensive (£11.99 standard or +£3.99 for DLC or £24.99 for FULL Game)Lacking in gameplayLacking in friends and other human being who play this game!4 base armies - Only 1 playableMICROTRANSACTIONS -game currencyUPLAY the most pointless and worst system if to be invented by mankind!

Then unfortunatly this game is not for you, and for this reason i cannot recommend it unlike Toy Soldiers:Complete which is the best game of the franchise.\\nNope.\\nBy far the worst CoD so far. This game is a huge dissapointment, I was banned for using a programme to change your FOV because at the time the game didn\\'t even have an option to change the FOV. So after I get it they say it is allowed to be used and for awhile the game was playable. But then they changed there minds and said that the FOV changer was now banned and the only way you would have known that is if you followed them on twitter! The games has the worst optimization ever, it is basically a console port and stutters all over the place. 70% of the people that play are hackers so almost every game you get into there will most likely a hacker in it. DON\\'T BUY THIS GAME.\\nOnce a game amongst legends. Now relegated to compete with Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare as the biggest jokes in gaming for 2016.EDIT: Servers are now infested with hackers since Valve took away our ability to kick people. 10/10 would not recommend this game as of this edit.\\nSpecs WAY too demandingThis game fits more on console than pc\\nOh dear oh dear oh dear, i\\'m so glad this game was only 40c when i bought it because it is definitley a stinking pile of dog doo doo. The controls are easy enough to get the hang of, but the story is like something from a Kevin Kostner movie, oh wait, it is. It\\'s the .....ier version of Water World. The voice acting is so damn atrocious it\\'s actually funny. The characters are cliche and the cutscenes have objects randomly floating arond your character as if they\\'re possessed. Don\\'t buy this game, unless you\\'re bored and want to have a good laugh, in that case, go right ahead and buy this .......t space waster. Game: 1/10, comedic value 10/10. \\nNO\\nI would like to reccomend this game to all, the story is great, arcade and more leave you with tons of fun but if you\\'re like me and bought it on PC mainly for multiplayer you\\'re goin to be dissapointed. You\\'ll spend most of your time waiting for someone to accept your request for match only to have MK crash, laggy fights or the connection just cant handle it. Anyway the game is stupidly good to play with lots of content offline,yet let down by horrible multiplayer.\\nneh neh neh na neh\\nGraphics are ok. Cars handle well. But this is the most frustrating racer out there. You can crash into anything and die however the AI cant die. literally cant die. If you wanna know whats its like to play this just hit yourself in the face with a bat.\\n11th Feb Udpate - Can\\'t play.. \\'Fatal Error\\' - No solution.

However, you can redeem the code on origion and origin lets you change wich version of the game you use. So you just have to change the game to a older version and it will work.\\nIt\\'s sad that it had to be really cr@p...\\nDLC\\'s are overpriced better off not getting them instead of forking out 100+ dollars for them!\\nThis game is OK but not worth the $1 to throw at it. Not know that this was an early access game I threw myself in to it hoping for a fresh game, one I haven\\'t seen before. So I did what I usually do... Not look at anything on the game. Well now I wish I would and finding out that it was early access after I had played it makes it worse. I already have a dislike to early access as most games get forgotten and unfinished and I don\\'t like the idea of paying for a game that hasn\\'t even been finished and the devise thought they could get a couple of bucks out of it before they actually bother finish it. I know this isn\\'t every early access game but a lot are like this. This game from the looks of it was either rushed, not cared about enough, or by inexperienced devise. Im sorry if it\\'s the last option but you will need some helpful criticism. First of all I noticed the controls for the torch, these are horrible you can either not do anything and it will snap to the direction you are facing which leads to very disorientating gameplay ad there is no smooth animation for the snap lock and leaves the player felling more or less dizzy, or you can hold the left mouse button the whole time to control the torch which is annoying while trying to do platforming but is much easier then the snap control. This was very annoying through he whole game as you do have to use the torch as a weapon and making it a prime function without taking much care for smooth animation is not done well. While trying to find an option to maybe have it as a consonant on the mouse control I found myself exiting the level which made me instantly dislike this game. First of all there was no are you sure you want to exit the level, second no indication what so ever through the game did it say if you want to exit the level press ESC, this may not seem like that big of a deal and it wouldn\\'t be in any other situation but in mine I was near the end of the level with all the collectibles and I had exited and was forced to play the level again but this time I ha dlost interest in collecting the letters. Another issue I have is that there are no options, none what so ever, except when you boot up the game it asks what graphics you would like windowed yes or no and resolution, for the very basic of settings these are there is no way to change them in game. One other thing that really bugged me about this game is the ... narrator, jeez can you come up with some different lines, every single level has the narrator saying the same thing over and over again, it\\'s like a broken record, and I\\'m not kidding at the start of every level there is the same cut scene of the narrator saying some bull and during every level he says the same thing, and at the end of every level there is another cut scene. Not to be discouraging the narrator has a nice voice but maybe get him a few more then 3 things to say. Now one thing that really bugged me about the game play was that every time you die you go all the way top the start of the level usually this would be OK, it gives consequence to the players death but it is so easy to die in this game from the odd camera angle and the (let\\' face it) cliché platforming with no real unique aspect means you have to start the level again and when this happens you loose all of your collectibles. This is the most frustrating part because even though the platforming is hard simply because of other issue and not the way it is designed, a big portion of the game comes froms getting the collectibles and after dying a few time to some random issue I quickly lost interest in getting the collectibles which unlock additional levels, which I could not bring my self to even collect the letter to play because I found myself wanting to stop playing this game instantly. Another aspect of the game I didn\\'t enjoy was the enemy if you can even call them that, there are two enemy\\'s, white slug things that slowly move towards you and little white sperm things that move quickly towards you, for a game with the subtitle \\'A game to fight inner demons\\' I did not find myself fighting any inner demons the most I got was having a good laugh at the ridiculous design of an \\'inner demon\\' and the variation of these inner demons (the small sperm things) do not come in till the 4th level which is the second last level in the game. Which brings me to my next point the length of this game is ridiculous it is less then an hour I\\'m sure if you went through all the levels getting the collectibles it be a bit longer but no more then 2 hours it is ridiculous, if you are going to make a game with this kind of game play and non existent story telling at least make it long enough so people get their moneys worth. Another aspect I found odd was music or the lack of, the first time I heard music was in the last stage of the game and there was no epicness to it like in dark souls where music would only play during boss battles but dark souls made the iteration of music mean something, it made the player feel like they were doing something epic not bloody doing mundane platforming.So if you are looking to buy this game I wouldn\\'t bother the $1 price it is definitely not worth it in the sate that it is in now.\\nCompletely bad. Its not fun when you have a good pc and the best way to run bo3 is .....The zombies was enaging and quite fun.Multiplayer felt like they thrown you into the game. \\\\Campain was, fine but it didnt feel like the other cods.Overall i\\'ll give it a 3/10.

Or just stick with Nexus Mods.\\nWhen I saw the other user reviews I thought that their playtimes were ridiculous and that you can\\'t jugde it based on 0.3 hours but when I tried it I found you can judge it on 0.3 hours, the \"tutorial\" doesn\\'t tell you anything about all the numbers popping on screen, it doesn\\'t bother eplaining them, fortunately it\\'s kind of obvious what they mean. It gives off the impression that it\\'s a basic match 3 game but NOPE it\\'s not, it\\'s got various mechanics that might have actually been cool. However they don\\'t bother explaining these until you have already figured them out, with the exception of the powers they do tell you about those.   Speaking about the powers, the ones they start you off with at first seem cool with Iron Man\\'s repulsor blast dealing like solid 63 damage but later on the enemies have so much health it begins to suck. Also the story, I can\\'t say I payed much attention to it because it was dumb but the writing was horrible it was cheesy and boring, not even cheesy and funny just boring and and the beginning they start off with Iron Man, yeah fine whatever but then they throw in Storm, for no reason at all just because why not, lets throw in a completely unrelated character to team up with Iron Man to take down some lame ... bad guys and the enemies have unoriginal names, like soldier and sniper. There is probably a pay to win aspect but I couldn\\'t play it long enough to notice, oh wait yes I could in the first 5 minutes they tried to force me to use some healing thing to heal my hero which wasn\\'t even badly damaged, if you don\\'t heal your heroes they can\\'t fight no matter how much health they have, they could be only 5 hp short and you\\'d just have to wait for them to heal or use up one health pack if your lazy and eventually enemies deal enough damage to prevent you from playing for a minimum if 4 minutes if you don\\'t use the health pack, how do you get more health packs? You either play missions which you can\\'t do because your hero is injured or you buy them. Don\\'t waste your time with this go play Bejeweled on your phone or something instead.\\nAbsalout ...., waste of money\\nIs gud\\nLaunched No Mans Sky: \"Oh my god I\\'m so excited!

It\\'s at this point that the game stops being a survival game, an starts to be an unpaid fulltime job. See the promise of a survival game is that the longer you play, the more survivable & fun it becomes as you master your terrain. Ark on the other hand, the more work you put in, the more work there is to put in. Once you\\'ve built your house of straw, it\\'s on to your house of wood, once you\\'ve got your house of wood, it\\'s on to the house of stone & it\\'s like that with literally everything in the game: There is no pay off.An if you are the least bit effective early on in the game, the leveling system outstrips the actual content, in that it stops being a survival game & rapidly becomes an eating, drinking & pooping simulator, because thats what you spend your entire time doing, as you wait for your xp to bring you up to the next level.As for the PVE aspects of the game they leave a lot to be desired. Dinosaurs just mill around, instead of moving with any purpose, and there are just way to heavily packed together on a map that is way to small. God help you if you don\\'t stick to the beach the entire time, because predatory dinosaurs are so common place off the beach that it often feels like you are being Zerged by small predatory dinosaurs, or worse yet the insects.Which brings me to my next issue: Movement tracking. I don\\'t mind combat with the dinosaurs, or at least i wouldn\\'t if i ever got in to combat with the dinosaurs, rather than shadow boxing the fart of existance that the program thinks are the dinosaurs locations, when actually the dinosaur is three feet, that a way.The game lacks for telegraphing so dinos attack, before lacky banding back to the location they were in, without passing through the space between. The worst offenders are the spitting dinosaurs & the raptors, but it\\'s alsoa problem with any of the insects, and even the Bronto\\'s who kill you by magic apparently, because you\\'ll never see what they hit you with. I\\'m sure there is a playable game under there somewhere, but it\\'s not nearly as deserving of praise as it\\'s currently getting.\\nSingle player (no friends) = .... this gameMultiplayer (Screaming 5 year olds) = Sell\\'s it for cs:go keysThis game is just boring unless you have friends to party along with.

NOT WORTH THE TIME TO PLAY AND LEARN\\nIf you ever wanted proof beyond a doubt that this game was developed on the wrong side of the border in Korea; You just have to try Tree of Savior, where everything under the sun is locked down. I am pretty sure this is not IMC\\'s first MMO rodeo but to hold the community to ransom due to \"Gold Traders\" and thereby remove the Massively out of MMO is not conducive nor giving them any points. Live everyday thinking how the spiritual successor could have been better then move on to something else ( come back a year after F2P and see if things have settled).

If you are a big Dead or Alive fan like I am and you dont own a console, buy this game. Otherwise, there\\'s no real other reason to buy it. It offers little that the console version didn\\'t, and doesn\\'t even have online play. The game runs well, but as it\\'s a PS3 port (yes PS3, not PS4) i would expect nothing less. It\\'s more DoA, if you need that in your life then get the game, otherwise, buy it on console or don\\'t buy it at all.\\nPretty neat art and the soundtrack is alright.But the story is boring as .... and the writing sucks.

It\\'s just... Not dynamic enough, I\\'ve found myself winning galaxy after galaxy... And that gets kinda old after a little while... I bought this game back in the days when it was expensive (Alpha), and they gave us a pair of crappy commanders that are buyables, they weren\\'t even novelty. They really don\\'t care or listen to their fans, so they released \"Titans\" even when we told them it would be better off a DLC or something. My Message To UberStep up and take responsibility, your fans aren\\'t here to wipe your asses with dollar bills. Instead Of This Piece Of Expensive Poop, Go Buy These Games On another note, I\\'d highly recommend Supreme Commander 1 & 2, Executive Assault and Earth 2160 instead of this thing, they\\'re cheaper and better made.

Part of it is the skill system, part of it is loot distribution, part of it is the linear nature of the story, and map design is also pretty bad. The game can be super easy/trivial on the parts I want to be challenging, and needlessly frustrating on the parts that should be simple. There are no \"multiple ways to solve a problem\" there is one way, except they don\\'t always tell you what that \"right way\" is. The game is a decent time-waster. It\\'s not terrible, I certainly put more time into than other games. But I\\'m not going to remember it in 5 years.  But this really was billed as a 2nd coming of F01/F02 and it\\'s not. It was a let-down, given the promises.\\nI JUST BOUGHT THIS AND NOTHING CHANGES IN GAME I DIDNT GET THE A6M5 THE XP 38 G NOTHING I WANT TO CONTACT VALVE FOR MY MONEY BACK IT SAYS I HAVE IT BUT IN GAME I DONT\\ni can\\'t play tf2 becuase of one of the update now any time i want to play tf2 i get the blue tv of death .p.s yes i use a tv to play games\\nBans my account for no reason Support instantly closes case and does not explain why .... game\\nThough I am giving it a negative review I actually realy liked the game.The only reason that I am giving it a negative review is due to the length, I just cannot reccomend a game so short.I mean 2.2 hours for a $20 game!?However, this game is incredible and if you can get it cheap or in a bundle like I did then it is definitely worth buying.This game, if it can be considered a game at all, is very different to other games, there is one central story for which you find recorded diaries and you play them to unravel a story, there are also other stories along the way that can be unveiled through other methods. If, despite my reccomendation you still desire to play it then you will be consumed by a beautiful story that will captivate and move you.If you have money to burn or get this game cheap then I would highly reccomend it.I give gone home 9/10,but the price tag 0/10.\\nDon\\'t get me wrong. I am the biggest Dark Souls fan you will arguably meet. It is my favourite game series of all time and I was undescribably hyped for this game. As of now, I cannot recommend it. Although my PC isn\\'t the best, I get a decent amount of frames which do make the game playable but that would make it a positive review, right? The game is bugged. It is in a bad, unstable state and needs to be patched. Currently, I cannot attack enemies and they cannot attack me. I can walk through them as if they were not there. I really hoped this wouldn\\'t continue, but I cannot progress through the game. Many of my friends with good PC\\'s also complained about the extremely long start-up times and FPS issues. However, from my point of view I cannot play the game. This review warns people of the bug and I hope this issue is fixed as I am desperate to play this game.EDIT: Discovered the only way I can be attacked or enemies can be attacked is if you strike their initial spawn location. Still makes the game unplayable.\\ni dropped the spaghetti :(\\nThe plot is good, the gameplay is good, the graphics are bad.Extreme caution though before you buy - the game can be extremely glitchy and crashy depending on environment, but many people have problems with it. If you\\'ll be able to fix it from crashing, you won\\'t be able to fix the giltches. The glitches that prevent you from simply enjoying the game, and also including the glitches that stop you from proceeding with the game.Also, it auto-saves to only 1 save. So you cannot go back or make your own saves - unless you manually quit out of the game and make backups of the freaking thing.So the game\\'s context is good, but bloody annoying technically.\\ni don\\'t like high textures, sorry.\\nThis game is now PLAYABLE! There is loot to be found! Zombies don\\'t phase through walls and smack you in the ....! I don\\'t walk up stairs and receive a black screen and watch the all too familiar words \"You are dead\" phase onto the screen. A good step in the right direction by the devs. If it continues like this and fulfills its potential, giving us an immersive, post-apocalyptic survival game we were promised then the game will be incredible. Though I still can\\'t recommend it due to the high price tag for an unfinished game that will remain unfinished for a very, very long time and sadly even on sales it is still rather high.\\nPatching took ages and stuffed up, and made it look like I played it more than I did.\\noh god why does this exist.  can i remove this embarassment from my library.  absolute pile of ...., free is too expensive for it\\nA game if you want to just shoot and shoot and not do much else.

Well, looks like ill still be playing Combat Arms this year..\\nNo Lamborghinis.0/10\\ntakes a long time to finish each matches, and anyways im just here for the tf2 items lol\\nthis \"game\" was using more than 60GB of my hard disk. Looking back, I think it wasn\\'t really worth it. Just uninstalled today and I feel like there are better things worth 60GB of data. Thanks to my friends for gifting me some of the DLCs, but I am not really enjoying the game so far...everytime I try to join a public lobby, I get kicked out of it for no reason, even if I ask first (if stealth/loud and safe to join?) before joining the actual game. Also 80% of payday lobbies are full of people using cheats, and I am pretty sure devs are going to do nothing about it.\\n80% religious propaganda, 20% achievement hunter bait. 100% unorigional.\\nNone of the servers WORK!!! WTF?\\nIf you want i game when you can kill and be dinosaurs get Ark not Primal Carnage. This game has little to offer in gameplay fectures and contect. Its fun for a few houers then it gets boring,also even though it is soley a multiplayer game its server could do with some work.\\nBueno que decir de este juego.ES UNA ......, NO SE PORQUE LO PONEN EN STEAM, LA .... QUE LOS PARIO.\\nI found this game similar to minecraft. But Terraria is diffferent, no beds classical pixal sandbox adventure and you dont know what to do after a while. I would recomend Starbound why? You will see\\nThis game is simply unfair at times some levels are litterly impossible if you want to score 100 percente do not buy this buy a good game\\nGot this as a gift. Even though i love old games, this one just bored me. I\\'d only recommend it for people who feel like playing something that looks like FFVII. Even then, i\\'d recommend just playing FFVII. btw unless you use winXP prepare to sell your soul to Satan just so it can run. 10/10 would play again.\\nSonic Adventure DX for PC is just so, amazingly... ok. It just trys to be something absolutly huge for the franchise, mixing dramatic storytelling with the rush of Sonic gameplay, and yeah, at the time and on the right hardware, this was revolutionary. Its just plain awful today.The advancements in PC gaming make the attempts for story telling, and the technology used for this effect just laughable. Seriously, the developers of the PC version must have LOW expectations. Your first playthrough of this game (all campaigns) will be memorable for years to come, but not in a good way.  Why?Because this PC port is complete .... Missing button presses was a frequent problem through my experience, no matter how many different keyboards and computers I played on. (tested on 5, btw) For example, During the final boss fight of Amy\\'s campaign, during phase 3, I game-overed 3 times from full lives because of the missed presses. In the fight, you have to jump over an obstacle. In my experience, Amy jumped probably 3/4 of the time. Eventually I got so badly ...... off at the game, I borrowed a second USB keyboard just to double my button presses.This problem was only present in the Boss fights. There is literally no reason for this.Why do I say thats its OK then? Well, Sonic Adventure DX is on the fence on being Good or Bad. The cornyness of the cinematics makes it funny and good, but only seconds later, a glitch where you are thrown uncontrolably off a stage by a pickup, losing a life and possibly game-overing you makes it bad. This effect (and unfortunatly glitch) happens frequently.If you are curious, wait untill it\\'s like $1 in a sale before you buy. Just the hours alone and ONLY the hours alone playing this game would justify that price. If you are on the fence, just don\\'t.Here\\'s hoping Sonic Adventure 2 isn\\'t this broken.\\nAbandoned by the Devs: DO NOT PLAY!\\nThe only reason that I got this is because I\\'m a diehard Half-Life fan. There is practically no reason to get this if you already have the original game. The only difference is the ragdoll and water effects, nothing more. Also, there is an enormous amount of bugs and glitches in this game. And there is no modding support either. If you want to get a FAR better remake of the classic game, get Black Mesa. \\nNo instructions and the game looks pretty bad.\\nThis game says its free but then it doesnt let me co-op with a mate without paying $35\\nI got hundreds of hours on this, then Overkill decided to add microtransactions on top of their $100 worth of DLC. It\\'s really disappointing what happened to this game.\\never heard of pay to play\\nStill no Australian Server, unless you like being called an Indo lagger and enjoy hitting invisible enemies, You\\'ll have fun with this game.\\nIf it wasn\\'t for the music this would be an immensely boring game.\\ndont get this It dosent work\\nbuggy as hell game ]\\nMicotransactions added to game means no chance of me ever getting back into it. Maybe if it was a F2P title i could understand...\\nthis game is awful and i regret purchasing it\\nDon\\'t buy it. It\\'s pretty boring, the old Ace Of Spades is better. MUCH better. And since I\\'m brazilian, I can\\'t play with a ping more than 100ms. And people only play TDM, Zombies and SOMETIMES classic.Download Build And Shoot or OpenSpades. It\\'s free.Build And Shoot is the classic Ace Of SpadesOpenSpades is the classic Ace Of Spades with better graphics.\\nDont buy. Barbarian update broke the game for me. It freezes every now and then and sometimes black screens\\nThis is simply in protest of Rockstar\\'s modding policies. Even banning people for modding in single player only get banned and that\\'s too far. For a popular PC game, especially GTA, you should of expecting modding from the start.\\nAfter taking a break from it for 12 months come back to find that my account is inactive. ask to reset password... website has continual errors on the final stage... you would think a game being sold on steam would let u play strait away but nope ..... the ....... at ubisoft have there own system and it doesnt work. so good luck if u forget your pass word becuase u just lost your game.\\nAn ageing F2P FPS that was brought down by its developers through the destruction of its former business model, making it a more pay-to-win game.

To start, the menus are a bit complicated to use due to its interface and support linguistic is not the best because the game is only found in too few languages. The gameplay is not as close to reality which hampers a little gameplay. The graphics is the least but could turn out to be improved. The game as it is, will not be appreciated by car lovers not call them much attention much less cause them to become tied hours to the game.Interface: 6 / 10Graphics: 5 / 10Gameplay: 5 / 10I hope they can improve the game and wish you good luck!\\nYou can never find games...Took me 30 minutes to find a game on Domination of only 8 people...Fix this. I know there is a fair amount of people playing the game, but the owners are like \"HAHA I WONT LET U JOIN THEM BECAUSE I WANT UR MONEY LOLOLOL\"Dont buy, I regret buying this game. Wont even find a simple Domination Game?.. Ha. Pathetic\\nPlease welcome the sequel to \\'Watch Grass Grow\\', its \\'Watch a Giant, Floating, Sentient Space Rock Grow\\'!

The matchmaking in this game is the worst, matches low tier players with high tier players and does the complete opposite of balancing the teams. Unless you are willing to throw down over $50 and get real lucky on the gambling stay away from this game.\\nYou really shouldn\\'t. I think it\\'s too boring. Imagine Warframe, except developed by Ubisoft, and costs $61.95. Not fun.  But thats my opinion.\\nThis game crashes the next day you opened it,hope it will be fixed about the broken launcher\\nwow much realism very boring such shoot\\nyou should buy fallout new vegas instead fallout 3\\nOh wonderful, a glitchy find an object game for 5 god damn dollars.11/10\\ni tried to play this game when i try to build my block disappears and i can\\'t build anymore 0/10\\ni hate this game. it ruined my life. i spent all my money on it and now i have no life. i live in the homeless centre. this is a warning to all who are looking to get this game DONT BUY\\nIt sucks thats all\\nU CAN NOT CONNECT THROUGH STEAM AND PLAY WITH YOUR MATES WARNING DO NOT GET THIS GAME._.\\nThis game would be fun it wasn\\'t ... optimised worse that a bag of hot steaming .....This game (by def) is capped at 30fps, and ported straight from console, almost no adjustments made.Yes DSfix can make the games playability levels a bit higher but it\\'s still ... laggy as all hell.I don\\'t know which game had a worse port - Dark Souls, or Resident Evil 4, Res Evil 4 had absolutely no controls listed as it was ported straight over though, meaning you have to google search to actually play the game, the good thing is though the game has an FPS higher than 9.Would definetly not reccomend, not unless you have an extremelly high-end computer.\\nBad,people just spam 1 op character 1/10\\nToo many bugs, poor texture quality and inconsistant frames..Not good enough\\nSo very disappointing.\\nFirstly before I get any hate, I KNOW this game is in early access. But, the game so far is very laggy. Loot barely spawns, and when you do find something decent you will probably be shot by another player in one of the taller buildings or you will be killed by the TELEPORTING nethers. I honestly wanted this game to be good, the concept is cool, the monsters are scary but the developers didn\\'t quite pull it off. What you are paying into is:-A pay-to-win style game-A lagfest-Scenery that looks like it was made by a five year-oldAt the moment I can\\'t recommend this game. It is fun to play with a friend for a couple of hours, but it gets very boring after a while. Save up another $5-$10 and buy a game which is more stable and fun like DayZ or Rust.3/10\\nVery disappointing. \\nWell i mean in one point of view i will say that this game is fun and the gun play in enjoyable even tho quite generic. And in the other point of view i will say that i could have enjoyed the game much more if i had managed to play it for more than 5 minutes without my computer having a stroke. Maybe its just me and im being too harsh but regardlessThere are lots of technical issues with this title that need to be fixed and im sorry but i cannot recommend this game.\\nNo mods = crappy game\\nI didn\\'t get my monies worth\\nGot it and two other copies for free, regret it and none of my friends will take them.\\nThis suck thats all deal with it!\\n- Bland and boring- Hackers- Crappy controls and gameplay\\nWhy does this even exist.\\nRust used to be fun before the major overhaul, nekmin poison seeped into the community that was already poisoned-laced. Our beautiful mountainside base was wiped, ofc as it was the major overhaul, but it was a very good base. Great memories made there, but NOW 12 year olds throw axes at you when you just want to cut down a damn tree. Why? Well perhaps it\\'s because they were on the lower end of the spectrum when they played CoD. I hate you all. I love Rust but hate you all.\\n4.5/10\\nGame is a hot mess of disaster, April 12 Update was a promise of fix and new content, but its just a piece of sh*t update, made everything have high requirements and everything difficult, even the free DLC was impossible to make, even with 4 players above the required armor gear. game is garbage after april 12th\\nSo terribly unbalanced it\\'s barley even playable.\\nVery Glitchy don\\'t buy it at full price maybe on a sale. 3/10\\nSlighly boring gameplay, Par graphics and a poorly optimised game for the PC makes this a tough review. I do enjoy simulators, but you have to be a train fan to really enjoy this game.\\nAfter wasting 1 hour just trying to log in, I can never connect to a god damm server.Can\\'t even review the game.\\nEven with the best computer in the world, it\\'ll still go at 20FPS!They haven\\'t released an update for a very long time and still haven\\'t fixed any of the glitches but they promise us something for Dota 2 so I guess that\\'s good enough (it\\'s an abandoned project and they expect it to be fine)! They made it way more complicated than it has too be, you can\\'t use CS:Source textures unless you go into the files of the programme and to spawn something simple, it takes ten minutes! 10/10, would waste hours again!\\nim getting a strange bug where i crash, not gpu/gpu/ram related and it pretty much ... my whole experience and i havent had the ambition to play it since5/10meh\\nThis game did not work for me as you can see i spent one hour of game time on it so i do not know that much the gameplay is well done i will give it that much but it needs more support for its players and the servers need to be fixed i want to recomend this game but i can not because i did not even get to play it for over 20 minutes\\nThe only game on steam that makes me feel like vomiting after playing for no more than 20mins\\nI want to recommend the game, but there are a heap of bugs and crashes still present that still exist 6+ months later.\\n9/11 not enough terrorism - ign\\nA very good game that suffers from F2P syndrome.Basically you\\'re a soldier with a tech power (cloaking, sheild, scan etc) that can hide behind objects to get stat boosts (ie: stability/accuracy) and you have to capture and/or defend points on the map. This gameplay is implemented well.Its worst problems are that people that don\\'t pay money, have to spend hours playing the game before they get gear that is normal for any other FPS (ie: grenades). Also you have to spend in-game currency to repair your armour (which is only a way to make you waste in-game currency)All in all, its not a bad game, but if you don\\'t intend spending money on it then I wouldn\\'t bother playing it.\\nOH MY GHOID  I CAN\"T EVEN JOIN NA ....ONING GAME< AND WHEN I DO I CANT EVEN WAKE UP\\nlike wtf is this like weres the anamils at like .... people say dayz standalone is a walking simulator liek .... this is worse\\nI wish I could provide a more externsive review of the game, however it kepy crashing in the Prologue. The fact that I couldn\\'t save the game, meant I had to replay it many times, only to enjoy more crashes and begin again. That aside, the camera controls were awkward and controlling your hero was pretty annoying. The fact that your heroes auto-used skills and spells felt like there was little need for me to control anyone, and that I was simply there to (try) and tell them where to move, and let them do the rest (which they were more than capable of dealing without me).I asked for a refund on this one, simply because of the controls and constant crashes. Unless the community builds some impressive content after the game is heavily patched, I\\'d not recommend.\\nSadly I would recommend this game, if it weren\\'t for the old and current price. I was stupidly persuaded into getting it and regretted it. The Escapists is fun but is really repetitive and there is no real sense of achievement. The workshop intergration and the map creator is fun but it is also really hard and there is no templates you can use. Overall-Do not recommend game unless it is on sale or gets a good update in the future\\nI like the game but i cant open it anymore since i update my driver,it says your ideo card does not support alpha blending floating point render target. can u fix this(it was fine before i update my driver).if u fix this i might give it another try\\ni can\\'t open this crab \\nGood game, needs more players.\\nFor MKX Mobile, if I want Cyber Jacqui and Undercover Cassie I need to buy an Xbox 1 Or PS4, not to mention how dead online is. -16/420\\nIts got a horrible engine and the graphics are .....\\nI caught this on sale for $3 and err.... im stuck with it... Well atleast it has fox people in it. Right??(On a side note, the story and soundtrack is absolutely horrible)\\nToo Hard To Find a room No one play This Bomb Match Grapple Match So Very very Bad Or i should say this is Too bad so no one plays it? Yeah it is\\nthe game has become abandonware(if you really want to buy it buy on a sale)\\nAlmost 3 years, and having gotten absolutely no where, Still in early access, Unresponsive Dev\\'s, Just stay away from this one guys...\\nThis might be a good game.

Tis good ginger. That is all.\\nSo painfully dull.\\nFor context, I have Windows 8 Pro 64-Bit.The problem is that this game is heavily dependent on GFWL which is riddled with compatibility issues. I have tried all practical - and some unorthodox - methods of trying to get to the game to work but to no avail. For $14.99, not really worth the gamble. Maybe for $4.99, but probably not at full price. If you do venture into this most unpredictable realm you should expect serious issues from the get-go. I am not saying that it definitely will not run on your Windows 8 computer but be prepared for stress. There is a decent chance the game will not run at all.\\nA zombie fell from the sky and killed me 11/10\\none of the most annoying games ever there are some good sides but its unbareable it takes about 5 days just to install it\\nRead the below reviews for more indepth analysis, but i will say this: KF1 was a simple game that worked amazingly well. KF2 manged to .... it all up in one fell swoop. aside from pretty graphics there is nothing that KF2 does better than KF1. If you\\'re thinking of buying this, dont. Buy KF1\\nCant open the game when i do a quarter of my screen goes black and then it says theres and error then it closes thanks for a waste of money\\nBad game. You can trust me. My play time is high\\nits weird and boring\\nWORST INVESTMENT DO NOT RECOMENDdo you like wasting your timethen this game is for ou this game is more of choir than a game with horrible realisem to boot\\nGarbageHorribly designed, terrible interface, buggy gameplay, buggy interface, buggy coding, buggy lobbies, runs like .... on high end systems, recycled combat for the past 12+ years, nothing innovative, lackluster and incoherent storyline for singleplayer, craptastic matchmaker, terrible netcode, looks like a game that was made 10 years ago (oh wait...), and worst of all the playerbase. Nothing remotely memorable about this game, or praiseworthy.  There is a very good reason this has a 4.5 out of 10 on Metacritic user reviews, this franchise of \"games\" is a joke and has been for years. This game and the company that supports it clearly appeals to autistics and 13 year olds that have no taste in games. Did I miss anything?\\nFor me almost a complete waste of money. I do not recomend buying this game\\nUses Live, if you don\\'t login, you can\\'t save.A good game let down by a ...... save system.\\nThe game turned from fun and games to BUY THIS TO UNBOX THIS FOR WHICH YOU NEED TO BUY THIS in 1 failed updateI am 11/10 dissapointed -Mr. Foster\\nNo local servers for Australia, so cant properly evaluate.\\nI\\'m not sure what it is but it felt so rushed, so untied and not very well polished as a game. The mechanics were a bit... meh and the whole story was .....! I wouldn\\'t pay more than $20 for this... and I did!! Gross. Want my money back tbh...If you want to play a sneak game with an amazing gameplay and story played Dishonoured. Not this!\\nspent over 2 hours doing the mission to rescue emeric finaly got him and ran from the Metal gear and the game tells me to run from it so i do and it leave the mission area setting me back alost 3 hours of game play. very poor checkpoint system and no save ruins the fun of the game. apart from that its great but setting me back that long is total BS.\\nthe new update made it HARDER TO GET IN A MATCH\\nIt wont open i have tried everything.

If there aren\\'r any player online to play with... this game make the same function than a rock on the road, nothing. The developers should add a single player.

I know i bought it during early acsess, but they could have kept the game the same instead of changing the entire game to make it really \\nThis game used to be good... I really liked it back then... but now there are rarely any players, and the only players that do play are pay2win/high leveled players... it had some really good potential but due to the lack of players... it\\'s drawn back... and if you actually wanna craft any of the good stuff you have to do a lot of continous crafting and buying .... off the auction to get the stuff you want... The pay2win on this is so bad, this game tries to force you into paying, everywhere you go... it tries every attempt to nickel your money.Other then that... the gameplay is suprisingly good, but like I said... I am afraid the game is just drawn back because of the community.\\nthis game is ... amazing but the consent crashing is making it almost impossible to play.\\nGood game but toxic community\\nI want a refund\\nThis game was amazing. Then it died. RIP BLACKLIGHT RETRIBUTION\\nI cannot even begin to describe my disgust for this game and how badly introduced you are into it... I\\'m so sorry but I\\'ve played CO and NWO and even though it\\'s taking me a little more time to be introduced to NWO... I just cannot get over and cannot express how terrible the tutorial is for STO and it is something I have literally never seen before, you\\'re literally placed into deep space after a quick introduction into the game where you learn how to fire a laser pistol, everything else you pretty much have to learn yourself... 30 minutes into the game play and only THEN did I figure it out that there wasn\\'t going to be a quest to show me when I should and what I should do with my skill points which were barely even visible to notice that I had aquired some, but apparently I ended up finding a side quest from some unkown button that was way out of the way and never spoken about at all within game that actually introduced me to it, but I should have taken it LONG before getting into my own space ship, the tutorials on this game are simply disgusting, the game is full of menus and yet can\\'t even explain a single thing that any of them do.. oh what\\'s that, I can change the name of my colleagues once for free in the colleague information window, yet I press every button to try and find the information window for my colleagues and yet I can\\'t seem to find it anywhere at all! this is one damn confusing game... oh and might I also add that there are plenty of little tweaks they could make to the game to make everything alot easier that even a monkey could think of yet that aren\\'t introduced into this game... overall a displeasent experience, I\\'ve seen flash games with better introductions and tutorials then this.\\nIn 2013, producer Almir Listo wrote that \"We\\'ve made it clear that Payday 2 will have no microtransactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!)\" -- LIAR and .... you very much!\\nTo many hackers Valve needs to do something about this ....\\nI do NOT recommend this game whatsoever! I paid 6+ dollars for it and it was NOT worth it , because, NOWHERE in the label or description does it say it  does not run on windows 8. I will be requesting Steam for my money back, and if they will not return my money, I will be heading to the devolopers to complain to them. I\\'m sure it\\'s good on windows 7, but those on windows 8, stay away!\\nIf anyone thinks I am writing this because i hate RWBY, just to clarfy i love RWBY [rip pyrrha :\\'c ]Will keep this spoiler free by putting [REDACTED] at points to censor the spoilersNow what I find good first:+ Beautiful environments, feels like I am in the world of remnant+ Characters look good, as do the enemies+ Fluid combat system but... [will put in negatives]Now... Those were the only good things, bad things now- Every character play nearly the same except weiss which she can be upgraded to range spam- There is no immersion in the characters as their semblances dont exist here [eg Yangs rage, Blakes decoys that take the hit for her etc]- Enemies are repetitive as well and once you learn their patterns its easy to get around their guard [if i could learn in my playtime, something went wrong]. Even the [REDACTED] is stupid as you can pratically stand still most of the fight and wait fo [REDACTED] then attack the weak point.- Short and easy campaign. The defense missions are a joke as you can just let the ones attacking the centre to attack it and it wont matter at all- All the projectile shots do the same damage [i would expect rubies 50 cal to do more than blakes 9 mm]- Boils down to the same comboes on most enemies [eg. Yang, Ruby and Blake use Light, Light, Heavy to take out the lightest enemies in one combo]Bugs t_t # Playing singleplayer will cause you to lose the levelling progress on your character# Counters and Finishers wont register properly sometimes leaving you vulnerableOverall: This game was not what i was wanting in a RWBY game. If they release a huge patch I will check it out and rewrite this review. At this point on a scale of 1-10: 4/10, Not worth it\\nthere is a bug where i cannot do the level  boss at solo tripwire pls fix this\\nCrap... Just crap...\\nI has high hopes for No Mans Sky, I really did. It seemed like a great exploration based game. The problem is that that isn\\'t what it actually is. It is being ordered around simulator 2016. Mine this, get that, fix this, and go there. The gameplay has little variety and it just isn\\'t fun to play. I am planning to refund it and get my hard-earned cash back. DO NOT buy this game based on the gype, it has little substance. On top of all that I tried to buy a new ship, only to find that it cost 100x more credits that I had 1 HOUR into the game, 10x for a new multi-tool. All I reccomend is to either not buy this game until at least some issues are resolved, or to try it and see what U think.\\nWell, it\\'s something, but not the jupiter sized planet, persistent universe, that I thought I was paying for.\\nNO JUST NOwell it lags LOTSSSSSSSSSS and its just ..... NO SUCKS NO JUST NO get some thing else NO JUST NO!!!!!\\n-Unlikeable and forgettable cast of characters-Predictible story-Intresting game play mechanic but used very poorly-Most choices lead to slightly different outcomes that are pointless-Cringe worthy dialog-Bad lip syncing-Choices have no real impact and are rendered pointless by the end of episode 5-Max\\'s powers are never explained -Chole -Boring gameplay+This game is finally complete+Some good music+The graphic were okFinal verdict-This game had the potential to be great, but it is boged down by poor story teling, boring gameplay, bad cast of characters, and bad dialog. Never have I been so bored playing a game, I was hoping for this game to pict up, but after 5 episode all I felt was a extreme sence of boredom and disappointment.It sad that best part of this game for me is when I uninstalled it.0.5/10\\n2/10I wanted to play some counterstrike until I was faced with a levelling system in order to play competitively. The ranks are worth nothing more than to say \"Ive played longer than you\" which still isnt any indication of skill. When will ranks be about actual skill level and less about total play time? Then theres the weapon skin franchise, which is basically encouraging kids to gamble which is quite sad. The amount of money you can sink into silly gun paint is ridiculous. I spent less than 5 bucks on about 10 different weapon skins with Stat-trak, instead of paying $2.50 for potential crap, so why bother buying keys and cases at all? If you want the excitement of gambling without actually wasting money, go watch the people who do 100 cases at a time on Youtube.\\nTerrible playerbase enough said\\nwas best game in the universe. armour tier locks destroyed it. is now worst game in history\\nThe FPS is the problemo here.\\nNo. Don\\'t even bother.\\nBuggy piece of ..... Money grab made easy to mod so people can still enjoy it. ... .........\\nGame still needs balancing\\nWhilst the game is overall really well designed and balanced, and incredibly fun, Unfortunately the PC version suffers, with NetCode so bad that it arguably becomes unplayable online. Lag spikes mean that for some characters, even performing simple special moves becomes effectively impossible, relying more on luck than actual skill.\\nhaving played through various stages of the beta, the current system feels too grindy, the weapons always look very similar when you customise them and higher level weapons are way too powerful because you can scarcely compete. there is fun to be had in this fast paced highly mobile third person shooter but it just feels like it misses the mark. highly customised weapons usually just mean a couple numbers behind the scenes and a different clip size, you live and die to quickly for you to play a completely different way based on whether or not your rockets scuttle or stick\\nThis game did not brought me back. Harambe - out.\\ngot banned for trolling hackers really ??? PULL YOUR FUUUUUCKEN HEADS IN CUUUUNTS\\nwell, bought the game. played it. Uninstalled it. Tryed to reinstall it. I NEED TO BUY IT AGAIN!!! WTF STEAM\\nI\\'m sad to say that Fallout 4 feels like a step back from Fallout 3 and New Vegas.Fallout 3 and NV had a great damage model for all difficulties, rewarding you for precise shots - while still making you quite vulnerable towards enemy attacks.In Fallout 4 enemies will sponge bullets (even getting 4-5 shots in the head most times won\\'t kill them), and they will run straight towards you and kill you within a few hits. It\\'s not challenging, it\\'s just a painful bore.The way difficulties of safes to lock-pick and terminals to hack is really scattered, it feels like they\\'ve just randomly chosen which ones will be novice, adept and masterful in terms of skill required, instead of placing expert locks in hard to reach areas, and novice ones in clear view places.I\\'m 8 hours in and I\\'m yet to meet an interesting character that influences my decisions and draws my attention into the conversation in any way.Also it is v-sync locked and 60fps locked (72 if you have 144hz monitor) and unlocking will speed up the game world and break dialogue options.\\nPaid mods... no thanks'"

    "BERT tokenization does involve a dictionary, but it's not a traditional word-to-meaning dictionary. Here's the breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No Simple Split: BERT uses a special technique called WordPiece tokenization. Instead of directly splitting sentences into words, it breaks them down into smaller units – subwords. These subwords can be whole words or parts of words.\n",
    "- Dictionary for Subwords: The dictionary in BERT's tokenizer is called a vocabulary. It maps each subword to a unique ID. This allows the model to efficiently represent words and even unknown words that can be constructed from known subwords.\n",
    "- Benefits of Subword Tokenization: This approach offers advantages:\n",
    "Handling Unknown Words: By breaking down words into subwords, BERT can handle words not present in its vocabulary. The model can represent them using combinations of known subwords (e.g., \"running\" can be represented as \"run\" and \"##ing\").\n",
    "- Efficiency: Subword units are often smaller than full words, leading to a more compact vocabulary and potentially faster training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an analogy: Imagine a dictionary with syllables instead of whole words. You can use syllables to represent most words, even if the exact word isn't there. BERT's vocabulary works similarly with subwords."
