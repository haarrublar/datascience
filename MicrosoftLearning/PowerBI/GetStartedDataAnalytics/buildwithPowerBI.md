## Intro

Microsoft Power BI is a complete reporting solution that offers data preparation, data visualization, distribution, and management through development tools and an online platform.

## Use Power BI

There are three primary components to Power BI:

- Power BI Desktop (desktop application): development tool.
- Power BI service (online platform): to organize, manage, and distribute your reports and other Power BI items.
- Power BI Mobile (cross-platform mobile app): allows consumers to view reports in a mobile-optimized format.

### Power BI Flow

The flow of Power BI is:

1. Connect to data with Power BI Desktop.
2. Transform and model data with Power BI Desktop.
3. Create visualizations and reports with Power BI Desktop.
4. Publish report to Power BI service.
5. Distribute and manage reports in the Power BI service.

## Building blocks of Power BI

The building blocks of Power BI are **semantic models** and **visualizations**. Create a semantic model and then use visuals to build a report.

### Create a semantic model

A semantic model consists of all connected data, transformations, relationships, and calculations. To follow the flow of Power BI, you first connect to data, transform data, and create relationships and calculations to create a semantic model.

### Create visualizations

In Power BI Desktop, when you create a visualization (also called visual), you add it to the canvas for a report page. Choose your visualizations to build pages in your report.

Power BI is a low-code solution, which means that you can "drag and drop" data field directly onto the canvas. Power BI will choose a visual for your data field. You can easily change between visuals for the same fields, and add or remove data fields to the visual.

### Create a dashboard

In the Power BI service, you can also create dashboards after you've published a report. Dashboards consist of a single page made up of tiles. Add tiles to a dashboard by pinning a visual in a report to the dashboard.

### Recap

The building blocks of Power BI are semantic models and visuals. Using Power BI Desktop, you create the semantic model and use visuals to create reports.

In the Power BI service, you can distribute content to your consumers and use reports to create dashboards.

## Power BI Service

### Organize items with workspaces

Workspaces are the foundation of the Power BI service. When publishing any report, you must choose a workspace. When you want to share content with others, always create and use a shared workspace.

### Distribute content

In a workspace, you can create an **app** (dashboard), which provides consumers a simplified interface to access reports and dashboards. In the app configuration, you set up the app, select the content to include (limited to the current workspace), and choose your audience.
